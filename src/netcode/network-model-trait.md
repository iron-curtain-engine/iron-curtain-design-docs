# NetworkModel Trait & Abstractions

## The NetworkModel Trait

The netcode described above is expressed as a trait because it gives us testability, single-player support, and deployment flexibility **and** preserves architectural escape hatches. The sim and game loop never know which deployment mode is running, and they also don't need to know if deferred milestones introduce (outside the `M4` minimal-online slice):

- a compatibility bridge/protocol adapter for cross-engine experiments (e.g., community interop with legacy game versions or OpenRA)
- a replacement default netcode if production evidence reveals a serious flaw or a better architecture

The product still ships one recommended/default multiplayer path; the trait exists so changing the path under a deferred milestone does not require touching `ic-sim` or the game loop.

```rust
pub trait NetworkModel: Send + Sync {
    /// Local player submits an order
    fn submit_order(&mut self, order: TimestampedOrder);
    /// Poll for the next tick's confirmed orders (None = not ready yet)
    fn poll_tick(&mut self) -> Option<TickOrders>;
    /// Report local fast sync hash (`u64`) for desync detection
    fn report_sync_hash(&mut self, tick: u64, hash: u64);
    /// Connection/sync status
    fn status(&self) -> NetworkStatus;
    /// Diagnostic info (latency, packet loss, etc.)
    fn diagnostics(&self) -> NetworkDiagnostics;
}
```

**Trait shape note:** This trait is lockstep-shaped — `poll_tick()` returns confirmed orders or nothing, matching lockstep's "wait, then advance" pattern. All shipping implementations fit naturally. See § "Deferred Optional Architectures" for how this constrains non-lockstep experiments (M11).

### Deployment Modes

The same netcode runs in five modes. The first two are utility adapters (no network involved). The last three are real multiplayer deployments of the same protocol:

| Implementation         | What It Is                                        | When Used                             | Phase   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `LocalNetwork`         | Pass-through — orders go straight to sim          | Single player, automated tests        | Phase 2 |
| `ReplayPlayback`       | File reader — feeds saved orders into sim         | Watching replays                      | Phase 2 |
| `EmbeddedRelayNetwork` | Listen server — host embeds `RelayCore` and plays | Casual, community, LAN, "Host Game" button | Phase 5 |
| `RelayLockstepNetwork` | Dedicated relay (recommended for online)          | Internet multiplayer, ranked          | Phase 5 |

`EmbeddedRelayNetwork` and `RelayLockstepNetwork` implement the same netcode. The differences are topology and trust:

- **`EmbeddedRelayNetwork`** — the host's game client runs `RelayCore` (see above) as a listen server. Other players connect to the host. Full sub-tick ordering, anti-lag-switch, and replay signing — same as a dedicated relay. The host plays normally while serving. Ideal for casual/community/LAN play: "Host Game" button, zero external infrastructure.
- **`RelayLockstepNetwork`** — clients connect to a standalone relay server on trusted infrastructure. Required for ranked/competitive play (host can't be trusted with relay authority). Recommended for internet play.

Both use adaptive run-ahead, frame resilience, delta-compressed TLV, and Ed25519 signing. They share identical `RelayCore` logic — connecting clients use `RelayLockstepNetwork` in both cases and cannot distinguish between an embedded or dedicated relay.

These deployments are the current lockstep family. The `NetworkModel` trait intentionally keeps room for deferred non-default implementations (e.g., bridge adapters, rollback experiments, fog-authoritative tournament servers) without changing sim code or invalidating the architectural boundary. Those paths are optional and not part of `M4` exit criteria.

### Example Deferred Adapter: `NetcodeBridgeModel` (Compatibility Bridge)

To make the architectural intent concrete, here is the shape of a **deferred compatibility bridge** implementation. This is not a promise of full cross-play with original RA/OpenRA; it is an example of how the `NetworkModel` boundary allows experimentation without touching `ic-sim`. Planned-deferral scope: cross-engine bridge experiments are tied to `M7.NET.CROSS_ENGINE_BRIDGE_AND_TRUST` / `M11` visual+interop follow-ons and are unranked by default unless a separate explicit decision certifies a mode.

**Use cases this enables (deferred / optional, `M7+` and `M11`):**

- Community-hosted bridge experiments for legacy game versions or OpenRA
- Discovery-layer interop plus limited live-play compatibility prototypes
- Transitional migrations if IC changes its default netcode under a separately approved deferred milestone

```rust
/// Example deferred adapter. Not part of the initial shipping set.
/// Wraps a protocol/transport bridge and translates between an external
/// protocol family and IC's canonical TickOrders interface.
pub struct NetcodeBridgeModel<B: ProtocolBridge> {
    bridge: B,
    inbound_ticks: VecDeque<TickOrders>,
    diagnostics: NetworkDiagnostics,
    status: NetworkStatus,
    // Capability negotiation / compatibility flags:
    // supported_orders, timing_model, hash_mode, etc.
}

impl<B: ProtocolBridge> NetworkModel for NetcodeBridgeModel<B> {
    fn submit_order(&mut self, order: TimestampedOrder) {
        self.bridge.submit_ic_order(order);
    }

    fn poll_tick(&mut self) -> Option<TickOrders> {
        self.bridge.poll_bridge();
        self.inbound_ticks.pop_front()
    }

    fn report_sync_hash(&mut self, tick: u64, hash: u64) {
        self.bridge.report_ic_sync_hash(tick, hash);
    }

    fn status(&self) -> NetworkStatus { self.status.clone() }
    fn diagnostics(&self) -> NetworkDiagnostics { self.diagnostics.clone() }
}
```

**What a bridge adapter is responsible for:**

- **Protocol translation** — external wire messages ↔ IC `TimestampedOrder` / `TickOrders`
- **Timing model adaptation** — map external timing/order semantics into IC tick/sub-tick expectations (or degrade gracefully with explicit fairness limits)
- **Capability negotiation** — detect unsupported features/order types and reject, stub, or map them explicitly
- **Authority/trust policy** — declare whether the bridge is relay-authoritative, P2P-trust, or observer-only
- **Diagnostics** — expose compatibility state, dropped/translated orders, and fidelity warnings via `NetworkDiagnostics`

**What a bridge adapter is NOT responsible for:**

- **Making simulations identical** across engines (D011 still applies)
- **Mutating `ic-sim` rules** to emulate foreign bugs/quirks in core engine code
- **Bypassing ranked trust rules** (bridge modes are unranked by default unless a separate explicit decision (`Dxxx` / `Pxxx`) certifies one)
- **Hiding incompatibilities** — unsupported semantics must be visible to users/operators

**Practical expectation:** Early bridge modes are most likely to ship (if ever) as **observer/replay/discovery** integrations first, then limited casual play experiments, with strict capability constraints. Competitive/ranked bridge play would require a separate explicit decision and a much stronger certification story.

**Sub-tick ordering in deferred direct-peer modes:** If a direct-peer gameplay mode is introduced later (deferred), it will not have neutral time authority. It must therefore use deterministic `(sub_tick_time, player_id)` ordering and explicitly accept reduced fairness under clock skew. This tradeoff is only defensible for explicit low-infra scenarios (for example, LAN experiments), not as the default competitive path.

### Single-Player: Zero Delay

`LocalNetwork` processes orders on the very next tick with zero scheduling delay:

```rust
impl NetworkModel for LocalNetwork {
    fn submit_order(&mut self, order: TimestampedOrder) {
        // Order goes directly into the next tick — no delay, no projection
        self.pending.push(order);
    }
    
    fn poll_tick(&mut self) -> Option<TickOrders> {
        // Always ready — no waiting for other clients
        Some(TickOrders {
            tick: self.tick,
            orders: std::mem::take(&mut self.pending),
        })
    }
}
```

At 30 tps, a click-to-move in single player is confirmed within ~33ms — imperceptible to humans (reaction time is ~200ms). Combined with visual prediction, the game feels **instant**.

### Replay Playback

Replays are a natural byproduct of the architecture:

```
Replay file = initial state + sequence of TickOrders
Playback = feed TickOrders through Simulation via ReplayPlayback NetworkModel
```

Replays are signed by the relay server for tamper-proofing (see `06-SECURITY.md`).

### Background Replay Writer

During live games, the replay file is written by a **background writer** using a lock-free queue — the sim thread never blocks on I/O. This prevents disk write latency from causing frame hitches (a problem observed in 0 A.D.'s synchronous replay recording — see `research/0ad-warzone2100-netcode-analysis.md`):

```rust
/// Non-blocking replay recorder. The sim thread pushes tick frames
/// into a lock-free queue; a background thread drains and writes.
pub struct BackgroundReplayWriter {
    queue: crossbeam::channel::Sender<ReplayTickFrame>,
    handle: std::thread::JoinHandle<()>,
}

impl BackgroundReplayWriter {
    /// Called from the sim thread after each tick. Never blocks.
    pub fn record_tick(&self, frame: ReplayTickFrame) {
        // crossbeam bounded channel — if the writer falls behind,
        // oldest frames are still in memory (not dropped). The buffer
        // is sized for ~10 seconds of ticks (300 frames at 30 tps).
        let _ = self.queue.try_send(frame);
    }
}
```

> **Security (V45):** `try_send` silently drops frames when the channel is full — contradicting the code comment. Lost frames break the Ed25519 signature chain (V4). Mitigations: track frame loss count in replay header, use `send_timeout(frame, 5ms)` instead of `try_send`, mark replays with lost frames as `incomplete` (playable but not ranked-verifiable), handle signature chain gaps explicitly. See `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 45.

The background thread writes frames incrementally — the `.icrep` file is always valid (see `05-FORMATS.md` § Replay File Format). If the game crashes, the replay up to the last flushed frame is recoverable. On game end, the writer flushes remaining frames, writes the final header (total ticks, final state hash), and closes the file.

## Deferred Optional Architectures (Not Shipping)

The `NetworkModel` trait preserves architectural escape hatches for fundamentally different networking approaches. **None of these are part of the shipping netcode.** IC ships one netcode: relay-assisted deterministic lockstep with sub-tick ordering. Everything above this section — sub-tick, QoS calibration, timing feedback, adaptive run-ahead, never-stall relay, visual prediction — is part of that single integrated lockstep system.

These deferred architectures are outside `M4` and `M7` core lockstep scope. They would require a separate explicit decision and execution-overlay placement to become active work.

### Fog-Authoritative Server (anti-maphack, `P-Optional` / `M11`)

Server runs full sim, sends each client only visible entities. Eliminates maphack architecturally. Requires server compute per game. See `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 1 and `research/fog-authoritative-server-design.md` for the full design.

### Rollback / GGPO-Style (`P-Optional` / `M11`)

Client predicts with local input, rolls back on misprediction. Requires snapshottable sim (D010 — already designed). Rollback and lockstep are **alternative architectures, never mixed** — none of the lockstep features above (sub-tick, calibration, timing feedback, run-ahead) would exist in a rollback `NetworkModel`. The current `NetworkModel` trait is lockstep-shaped (`poll_tick()` returns confirmed-or-nothing); rollback would need trait extension or game loop restructuring in `ic-game`. `ic-sim` stays untouched (invariant #2). Stormgate (2024) proved RTS rollback is production-viable at 64 tps; delta rollback (Dehaene, 2024) reduces snapshot cost to ~5% via Bevy `Changed<T>` change detection. Full analysis in `research/stormgate-rollback-relay-landscape-analysis.md`.

### Cross-Engine Protocol Adapter

A `ProtocolAdapter<N>` wrapper translates between Iron Curtain's native protocol and other engines' wire formats (e.g., OpenRA). Uses the `OrderCodec` trait for format translation. See `07-CROSS-ENGINE.md` for full design.

## OrderCodec: Wire Format Abstraction

For cross-engine play and protocol versioning, the wire format is abstracted behind a trait:

```rust
pub trait OrderCodec: Send + Sync {
    fn encode(&self, order: &TimestampedOrder) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
    fn decode(&self, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<TimestampedOrder>;
    fn protocol_id(&self) -> ProtocolId;
}

/// Native format — fast, compact, versioned (delta-compressed TLV)
pub struct NativeCodec { version: u32 }

/// Translates to/from OpenRA's wire format
pub struct OpenRACodec {
    order_map: OrderTranslationTable,
    coord_transform: CoordTransform,
}
```

See `07-CROSS-ENGINE.md` for full cross-engine compatibility design.
