## Vulnerability 53: Direct-Peer Replay Peer-Attestation Gap (Deferred Optional Mode)

### The Problem

**Severity: MEDIUM**

In deferred direct-peer modes (for example, explicit LAN/experimental variants without relay authority), replays are recorded locally by each client. There is no mutual attestation — a player can modify their local replay to remove evidence of cheating or alter match outcomes. Since there is no relay server to act as a neutral observer, replay integrity depends entirely on the local client.

### Mitigation

**Peer-attested frame hashes:** At the end of each sim tick, all peers exchange signed hashes of their current sim state (already required for desync detection). These signed hashes are recorded in each peer's replay file, creating a cross-attestation chain.

```rust
pub struct PeerAttestation {
    pub tick: SimTick,
    pub peer_id: PlayerId,
    pub state_hash: SyncHash,
    pub peer_signature: Ed25519Signature,
}
```

**Replay reconciliation:** When a dispute arises, replays from all peers can be compared. Frames where peer-attested hashes diverge from the replay's recorded state indicate tampering. The attestation chain provides cryptographic proof of which peer's replay was modified.

**End-of-match summary signing:** At match end, all peers sign a match summary (final score, duration, player list, final state hash). This summary is embedded in all replays and can be independently verified.

**Phase:** This ships only if a direct-peer gameplay mode is explicitly enabled by future decision. Peer hash exchange is the corresponding exit criterion for that mode.

## Vulnerability 54: Anti-Cheat False-Positive Rate Targets

### The Problem

**Severity: MEDIUM**

The behavioral anti-cheat system (fog-of-war access patterns, APM anomaly detection, click accuracy outliers) has no defined false-positive rate targets. Without explicit thresholds, aggressive detection can alienate legitimate high-skill players while lenient detection misses actual cheaters.

### Mitigation

**Tiered confidence thresholds:**

| Detection Category       | Action          | Minimum Confidence | Max False-Positive Rate |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Fog oracle (maphack)     | Auto-flag       | 95%                | 1 in 10,000 matches     |
| APM anomaly (bot)        | Auto-flag       | 99%                | 1 in 100,000 matches    |
| Click precision (aimbot) | Review queue    | 90%                | 1 in 1,000 matches      |
| Desync pattern (exploit) | Auto-disconnect | 99.9%              | 1 in 1,000,000 matches  |

**Calibration dataset:** Before deployment, each detector is calibrated against a corpus of labeled replays: confirmed-cheating replays (from test accounts) and confirmed-legitimate replays (from high-skill tournament players). The false-positive rate is measured against the legitimate corpus.

**Graduated response:** No single detection event triggers a ban. The system uses a point-based accumulation model:
- Auto-flag: +1 point (decays after 30 days)
- Review-confirmed: +5 points (no decay)
- 10 points → temporary suspension (7 days) + manual review
- 25 points → permanent ban (appealable)

**Transparency report:** Aggregate anti-cheat statistics (total flags, false-positive rate, ban count) are published quarterly. Individual detection details are not disclosed (to avoid teaching cheaters to evade).

**Continuous calibration (post-deployment feedback loop):** The pre-deployment calibration corpus is a starting point, not a static artifact. Drawing from VACNet's continuous retraining model, IC maintains a living calibration pipeline:

1. **Confirmed-cheat ingestion:** When a human reviewer confirms a flagged player as cheating, the relevant replays are automatically added to the "confirmed-cheat" partition of the calibration corpus. When an appeal succeeds, the replays move to the "false-positive" partition.
2. **Threshold recalibration:** Population baselines (V12) and detection thresholds are recomputed weekly from the updated corpus. If the confirmed-cheat partition grows to include a new cheat pattern (e.g., a novel tool that evades the current entropy check), the recalibrated thresholds will detect it in subsequent matches.
3. **Model drift monitoring:** The ranking server tracks detection rates, false-positive rates, and appeal rates over rolling 90-day windows. A sustained increase in appeal success rate signals model drift — the thresholds are catching more legitimate players than they should. A sustained decrease in detection rate signals evasion evolution — cheat tools have adapted.
4. **Corpus hygiene:** The calibration corpus is versioned with timestamps. Replays older than 12 months are archived (not deleted) and excluded from active calibration to prevent stale patterns from anchoring thresholds.

**Phase:** Continuous calibration pipeline ships with ranked matchmaking (Phase 5). Initial corpus creation is the Phase 5 exit criterion; the feedback loop activates post-launch once human review generates confirmed cases.

**Phase:** False-positive calibration ships with ranked matchmaking (Phase 5). Calibration dataset creation is a Phase 5 exit criterion.

## Vulnerability 55: Platform Bug vs Cheat Desync Classification

### The Problem

**Severity: MEDIUM**

Desync events (clients diverging from deterministic sim state) can be caused by either legitimate platform bugs (floating-point differences across CPUs, compiler optimizations, OS scheduling) or deliberate cheating (memory editing, modified binaries). The current desync detection treats all desyncs uniformly, which can lead to false cheat accusations from genuine bugs.

### Mitigation

**Desync fingerprinting:** When a desync is detected, the system captures a diagnostic fingerprint: divergence tick, diverging state components (which ECS resources differ), hardware/OS info, and recent order history. Platform bugs produce characteristic patterns (e.g., divergence in physics-adjacent systems on specific CPU architectures) that differ from cheat patterns (e.g., divergence in fog-of-war state or resource counts).

**Classification heuristic:**

| Signal                                        | Likely Platform Bug | Likely Cheat        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Divergence in position/pathfinding only       | ✓                   |                     |
| Divergence in fog/vision state                |                     | ✓                   |
| Divergence in resource/unit count             |                     | ✓                   |
| Affects multiple independent matches          | ✓                   |                     |
| Correlates with specific CPU/OS combination   | ✓                   |                     |
| Divergence immediately after suspicious order |                     | ✓                   |
| Both peers report same divergence point       | ✓                   |                     |
| Only one peer reports divergence              |                     | ✓ (modified client) |

**Bug report pipeline:** Desyncs classified as likely-platform-bug are automatically filed as bug reports with the diagnostic fingerprint. These do not count toward anti-cheat points (V54).

**Phase:** Desync classification ships with anti-cheat system (Phase 5). Classification heuristic is a Phase 5 exit criterion.

## Vulnerability 56: RTL/BiDi Override Character Injection in Non-Chat Contexts

### The Problem

**Severity: LOW**

D059 (09g-interaction.md) defines RTL/BiDi sanitization for chat messages and marker labels, but other text-rendering contexts — player display names (see V46), package descriptions, mod names, lobby titles, tournament names — may not pass through the same sanitization pipeline, allowing BiDi override characters to create misleading visual presentations.

### Mitigation

**Unified text sanitization pipeline:** All user-supplied text passes through a single sanitization function before rendering, regardless of context. The pipeline:

1. Strip dangerous BiDi overrides (U+202A–U+202E) except in contexts where explicit direction marks are legitimate (chat with mixed-direction text uses U+2066–U+2069 isolates instead)
2. Normalize Unicode to NFC form
3. Apply context-specific length/width limits
4. Validate against context-specific allowed script sets

**Context registry:** Each text-rendering context (chat, display name, package title, lobby name, etc.) registers its sanitization policy. The pipeline applies the correct policy based on context, preventing bypass through context confusion.

**Cross-reference:** V46 (display name confusables), D059 (chat/marker sanitization), RTL/BiDi QA corpus categories E and F.

**Phase:** Unified text pipeline ships with UI system (Phase 3). Pipeline coverage for all user-text contexts is a Phase 3 exit criterion.

## Vulnerability 57: ICRP Local WebSocket Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)

### The Problem

**Severity: HIGH**

D071 (IC Remote Protocol) exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 API over WebSocket on localhost for local tool integration (MCP server for LLM coaching, LSP server for mod development, debug overlay). A malicious web page opened in the user's browser can initiate a WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:<port>` — the browser sends the page's cookies and the WebSocket handshake does not enforce same-origin policy by default. This is Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).

If the ICRP server accepts any incoming WebSocket connection without origin validation, a malicious page can:
- Read game state (fog-filtered for observer tier, but still leaks match information)
- Issue commands at the user's permission tier (if the local session has admin/mod permissions)
- Exfiltrate replay data, player statistics, or configuration

**Real-world precedent:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code Live Share, and Electron apps have all patched CSWSH vulnerabilities in local WebSocket servers. The attack requires only that the user visits a malicious page while the game is running.

### Defense

**Origin header validation (mandatory):**

```rust
fn validate_websocket_upgrade(request: &HttpRequest) -> Result<(), IcrpError> {
    let origin = request.header("Origin");
    match origin {
        // No Origin header — non-browser client (curl, MCP, LSP). Allow.
        None => Ok(()),
        // Localhost origins — same-machine tools. Allow.
        Some(o) if o.starts_with("http://localhost")
               || o.starts_with("http://127.0.0.1")
               || o.starts_with("http://[::1]")
               || o == "null" => Ok(()),
        // Any other origin — browser page from a different site. Reject.
        Some(o) => {
            tracing::warn!("CSWSH attempt blocked: origin={}", o);
            Err(IcrpError::ForbiddenOrigin)
        }
    }
}
```

**Challenge secret file:**

For elevated permission tiers (admin, mod, debug), the ICRP server generates a random 256-bit challenge secret and writes it to `<data_dir>/icrp-secret` with restrictive file permissions (0600 on Unix, user-only ACL on Windows). Connecting clients must present this secret in the first JSON-RPC message. A browser-based CSWSH attack cannot read local files, so this blocks privilege escalation even if origin validation is bypassed.

**HTTP fallback CORS whitelist:**

The HTTP fallback endpoint (D071) applies standard CORS headers: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:<port>` (not `*`). Pre-flight `OPTIONS` requests validate the origin before processing.

**Additional hardening:**

- ICRP binds to `127.0.0.1` only by default. Binding to `0.0.0.0` requires explicit `--icrp-bind-all` flag with a console warning.
- WebSocket connections from browser origins (any `Origin` header present) are limited to observer-tier permissions regardless of challenge secret. Full permissions require a non-browser client (no `Origin` header).
- Rate limit: max 5 failed challenge attempts per minute per IP. Exceeding triggers 60-second lockout.

**Phase:** Ships with ICRP implementation (Phase 5). Origin validation and challenge secret are Phase 5 exit criteria. CSWSH is added to the threat model checklist for any future localhost-listening service.

## Vulnerability 58: Lobby Host Configuration Manipulation

### The Problem

**Severity: MEDIUM**

The lobby host selects game configuration (map, game speed, starting units, crates, fog settings, balance preset). In ranked play, certain configurations are restricted to the ranked whitelist (D055). But in unranked lobbies, a malicious host could:
- Change settings silently after players have readied up (race condition between ready confirmation and game start)
- Set configurations that advantage the host (e.g., changing starting position after seeing the map)
- Modify settings that affect ranked eligibility without clear indication to other players

### Defense

**Settings change notification:**

- Every lobby setting change emits a `LobbySettingChanged { key, old_value, new_value, changed_by }` message to all connected clients. The client UI displays a visible notification (toast + chat-style log entry) for each change.
- If any setting changes after a player has readied up, that player's ready status is automatically reset with a notification: "Settings changed — please re-confirm ready."

**Ranked configuration whitelist:**

- Ranked lobbies enforce a strict whitelist of allowed configurations defined in the ranking authority's `server_config.toml` (D064). The host cannot modify restricted settings when the lobby is marked as ranked.
- Settings outside the whitelist are grayed out in the lobby UI with a tooltip: "Locked for ranked play."
- The whitelist is versioned and signed by the ranking authority. Clients validate the whitelist version on lobby join.

**Match metadata recording:**

- All lobby settings at the moment of game start are recorded in the `CertifiedMatchResult` (V13) by the relay server. The ranking authority validates that recorded settings match the ranked whitelist before accepting the match result.
- This provides an audit trail — if a host exploits a race condition to change settings between ready and start, the recorded settings reveal the discrepancy.

**Phase:** Lobby setting notifications ship with lobby system (Phase 3). Ranked whitelist enforcement ships with ranked system (Phase 5). Match metadata recording ships with relay certification (Phase 5).

## Vulnerability 59: Ranked Spectator Minimum Delay Enforcement

### The Problem

**Severity: MEDIUM**

Observers in lockstep RTS games receive the full game state (all player orders). Without a delay, a spectator colluding with a player could relay opponent positions and orders in real time — effectively a maphack via social channel. D060 mentions observer delay as a concept but does not specify a minimum floor for ranked play.

### Defense

**Mandatory minimum observer delay for ranked matches:**

- Ranked matches enforce a **minimum 120-second observer delay**. This is a `ProtocolLimits`-style hard floor — not configurable below 120s by lobby settings, server config, or console commands.
- **Enforcement is in wall-clock seconds, not fixed ticks.** The relay computes the minimum tick count at match start from the match's game speed: `min_delay_ticks = floor_secs × tps_for_speed_preset` (e.g., 120s × 20 tps = 2,400 ticks at Normal; 120s × 50 tps = 6,000 ticks at Fastest). If the operator's configured `spectator.delay_ticks` falls below this computed minimum, the relay clamps it upward. This ensures the wall-time floor holds regardless of game speed preset (D060).
- Implementation: The relay server buffers observer-bound state updates and releases them only after the delay window. The buffer is per-observer, not shared — each observer's view is independently delayed.
- The 120-second floor is chosen because it exceeds the tactical relevance window for most RTS engagements (build order scouting is revealed by 2 minutes anyway, and active combat decisions have ~5-10 second relevance).

**Tiered delay policy:**

| Context         | Minimum Delay | Configurable Above Floor |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Ranked match    | 120 seconds   | Yes (host can increase)  |
| Unranked match  | 0 seconds     | Yes (host sets freely)   |
| Tournament mode | 180 seconds   | Server operator sets     |
| Replay playback | N/A           | Full speed available     |

**Enforcement point:** The relay server is authoritative for observer delay — the client cannot bypass it by modifying local configuration. The delay value for each match is recorded in the `CertifiedMatchResult` metadata.

**Cross-reference:** D055 (ranked exit criteria — add observer delay to ranked integrity checklist), D060 (netcode parameter philosophy — observer delay is Tier 3, always-on for ranked), V13 (match certification metadata).

**Phase:** Observer delay enforcement ships with spectator system (Phase 5). The 120-second ranked floor is a Phase 5 exit criterion for D055.

## Vulnerability 60: Observer Mode RNG State Prediction

### The Problem

**Severity: LOW**

In lockstep multiplayer, all clients (including observers) process the same deterministic simulation. An observer therefore has access to the RNG state and can predict future random outcomes (e.g., damage rolls, crate spawns, scatter patterns). A colluding observer could inform a player of upcoming favorable/unfavorable RNG outcomes.

This is an inherent limitation of lockstep architecture — the RNG state is derivable from the simulation state that all participants share.

### Defense

**Acknowledged limitation with layered mitigations:**

This vulnerability is **not fully closable** in lockstep architecture without server-authoritative RNG (which would require a fundamentally different network model). Instead, layered mitigations reduce the practical impact:

1. **Ranked observer delay (V59):** The 120-second delay makes RNG prediction tactically irrelevant — by the time the observer sees the state, the predicted outcomes have already resolved.
2. **Fog-authoritative server (for high-stakes play):** In fog-authoritative mode, observers receive only visibility-filtered state, which limits (but does not fully eliminate) RNG state inference. This is the recommended mode for tournaments.
3. **RNG state opacity:** The sim's PRNG (deterministic, seedable) does not expose its internal state through any API observable to mods or scripts. Prediction requires reverse-engineering the PRNG sequence from observed outcomes — feasible but requires significant effort per-match.
4. **Post-match detection:** If a player consistently exploits predicted RNG outcomes (e.g., always attacking when the next damage roll is favorable), the behavioral model (V12) can detect the unnatural correlation between action timing and RNG outcomes over a sufficient sample of matches.

**Documentation note:** This is a known-and-accepted limitation common to all lockstep RTS games (SC2, AoE2, original C&C). No lockstep game has solved generic RNG prediction because the simulation state is, by design, shared. The fog-authoritative server eliminates this class entirely for any deployment willing to run server-side simulation.

**Phase:** Documentation only (no implementation change). Observer delay (V59) and fog-authoritative server provide the practical mitigations.

## Vulnerability 61: Local Credential Theft from SQLite Databases

### The Problem

**Severity: HIGH**

Iron Curtain is open source — the database schema, file paths, and storage format are public knowledge. An attacker who gains same-user filesystem access (malware, physical access to an unlocked machine, shared PC, stolen backup archive) can:

1. Read `profile.db` and extract OAuth tokens, refresh tokens, and API keys from known columns
2. Use stolen OAuth refresh tokens to mint new access tokens indefinitely, incurring billing on the victim's LLM provider account
3. Copy `keys/identity.key` and attempt to brute-force a weak passphrase to impersonate the player

This is not theoretical — credential-stealing malware targeting open-source applications with known file layouts is well-documented (browser password DBs, Discord token files, SSH private keys).

### Defense

**Three-tier `CredentialStore` with mandatory encryption at rest:**

IC never stores sensitive credentials as plaintext in SQLite. All credential columns (`api_key`, `oauth_token`, `oauth_refresh_token`) contain AES-256-GCM encrypted BLOBs. The Data Encryption Key (DEK) is protected by a tiered system:

| Tier                  | Environment                                   | DEK Protection                                                                                               | User Experience                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Tier 1** (primary)  | Desktop with OS keyring                       | DEK stored in OS credential store: Windows DPAPI, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service (via `keyring` crate) | Transparent — no extra prompts |
| **Tier 2** (fallback) | Headless Linux, containers, portable installs | DEK derived from user-provided vault passphrase via Argon2id (t=3, m=64MiB, p=1)                             | Prompted once per session      |
| **Tier 3** (WASM)     | Browser builds                                | Session-only — secrets not persisted to storage                                                              | Re-enter each session          |

**Critical design choice:** There is no "silent" machine-derived key fallback. The previous `derive_machine_key()` approach (MAC address + username + fixed salt → PBKDF2) is **security theater** in an open-source project — same-user malware can reproduce it. If no OS keyring is available, the user must explicitly set a vault passphrase. If they decline, LLM credentials are not persisted.

**Additional protections:**
- **Memory zeroization:** Decrypted secrets use `Zeroizing<T>` wrappers (`zeroize` crate, RustCrypto) — memory is overwritten on drop
- **Per-value encryption:** Individual SQLite columns encrypted (not whole-database SQLCipher), allowing non-sensitive data to remain readable without the DEK
- **AAD binding:** Each encrypted blob includes Associated Authenticated Data (table + column + row ID), preventing column/row swapping attacks
- **Export prohibition:** API keys and tokens are never included in Workshop config exports, `ic llm export`, or telemetry
- **Backup safety:** Encrypted columns remain encrypted in `ic backup create` ZIPs (DEK is not in the backup)
- **Identity key independence:** Ed25519 private key has its own AEAD encryption with user passphrase (BIP-39 derivation path, independent of the LLM credential DEK)

**Decryption failure recovery:** If the DEK is unavailable (new machine, keyring cleared, forgotten vault passphrase) or an encrypted blob is corrupted, the affected providers are flagged as needing attention. The player sees a non-blocking banner — "Some AI features need your attention" — only when they actually trigger an LLM-gated action, not at game launch (Progressive Disclosure). The banner offers [Fix Now →] (opens affected provider's credential form — all non-sensitive settings preserved), [Use Built-in AI] (silent Tier 1 fallback for the session), or [Not Now] (dismiss with anti-nag suppression). In Settings → LLM, affected providers show ⚠ badges with [Sign In] buttons. A no-dead-end guidance panel (UX Principle #3) appears when the player triggers a feature whose assigned provider is broken, offering direct resolution paths instead of opaque error strings. Vault passphrase reset is available through UI (Settings → Data → Security → [Reset Vault Passphrase]) in addition to the `/vault reset` console command. Credentials fail-safe to "re-enter" rather than fail-open to "exposed" or fail-hard to "unusable." See `research/credential-protection-design.md` § Decryption Failure Recovery for the full UX spec.

**Honest limitations:**
- Same-user malware with OS keyring access can still retrieve the DEK (this is true for ALL desktop applications — Chrome, VS Code, Git Credential Manager)
- Tier 2 is only as strong as the vault passphrase. Argon2id makes brute-forcing expensive but not impossible for weak passphrases
- Swap file / hibernation may page decrypted secrets to disk. Mitigation: full-disk encryption (user's responsibility)

The credential store raises the bar from "copy a file" to "execute code as the user on a running session" — a meaningful improvement against the most common attack vectors (disk theft, backup theft, casual snooping, most credential-stealing malware).

**Cross-reference:** `research/credential-protection-design.md` (full design spec), D047 (LLM credential schema), D052 (`keys/identity.key` encryption), D061 (backup credential safety), D034 (SQLite storage, `vault_meta` table).

**Phase:** `CredentialStore` implementation in `ic-paths` is Phase 2 (M2). LLM credential encryption is Phase 7 (M11). Vault passphrase CLI is Phase 2 (M2).

## Path Security Infrastructure

All path operations involving untrusted input — archive extraction, save game loading, mod file references, Workshop package installation, replay resource extraction, YAML asset paths — require boundary-enforced path handling that defends against more than `..` sequences.

The [`strict-path`](https://github.com/iron-curtain-engine/strict-path-rs) crate (MIT/Apache-2.0, compatible with GPL v3 per D051) provides compile-time path boundary enforcement with protection against 19+ real-world CVEs:

- **Symlink escapes** — resolves symlinks before boundary check
- **Windows 8.3 short names** — `PROGRA~1` resolving outside boundary
- **NTFS Alternate Data Streams** — `file.txt:hidden` accessing hidden streams
- **Unicode normalization bypasses** — equivalent but differently-encoded paths
- **Null byte injection** — `file.txt\0.png` truncating at null
- **Mixed path separator tricks** — forward/backslash confusion
- **UNC path escapes** — `\\server\share` breaking out of local scope
- **TOCTOU race conditions** — time-of-check vs. time-of-use via built-in I/O

**Integration points across Iron Curtain:**

| Component                               | Use Case                                               | `strict-path` Type |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `ic-cnc-content` (`.oramap` extraction) | Sandbox extracted map files to map directory           | `PathBoundary`     |
| `ic-cnc-content` (`.meg` extraction)    | Sandbox Remastered MEG entries to mod directory (D075) | `PathBoundary`     |
| Workshop (`.icpkg` extraction)          | Prevent Zip Slip during package installation (D030)    | `PathBoundary`     |
| `p2p-distribute` (torrent file writes)  | Sandbox downloaded content to torrent directory (D076) | `PathBoundary`     |
| Save game loading                       | Restrict save file access to save directory            | `PathBoundary`     |
| Backup restore (ZIP extraction)         | Sandbox backup extraction to `<data_dir>` (D061)       | `PathBoundary`     |
| Replay resource extraction              | Sandbox embedded resources to cache (V41)              | `PathBoundary`     |
| WASM `ic_format_read_bytes`             | Enforce mod's allowed file read scope                  | `PathBoundary`     |
| Mod file references (`mod.toml`)        | Ensure mod paths don't escape mod root                 | `PathBoundary`     |
| YAML asset paths (icon, sprite refs)    | Validate asset paths within content directory (V33)    | `PathBoundary`     |

This supersedes naive string-based checks like `path.contains("..")` (see V33) which miss symlinks, Windows 8.3 short names, NTFS ADS, encoding tricks, and race conditions. `strict-path`'s compile-time marker types (`PathBoundary` vs `VirtualRoot`) provide domain separation — a path validated for one boundary cannot be accidentally used for another.

**Adoption strategy:** `strict-path` is integrated as a dependency of `ic-cnc-content` (archive extraction including `.oramap` and `.meg`), `ic-game` (save/load, replay extraction, backup restore), `ic-script` (WASM file access scope), and `p2p-distribute` (torrent file path validation — D076 standalone crate). `ic-paths` provides convenience methods (`AppDirs::save_boundary()`, `AppDirs::mod_boundary()`, etc.) that produce `PathBoundary` instances from resolved platform directories. All public APIs that accept filesystem paths from untrusted sources take `StrictPath<PathBoundary>` instead of `std::path::Path`.

## Competitive Integrity Summary

Iron Curtain's anti-cheat is **architectural, not bolted on.** Every defense emerges from design decisions made for other reasons:

**No kernel-level anti-cheat.** Open-source, cross-platform, no ring-0 drivers. We accept that lockstep RTS will always have a maphack risk in client-sim modes — the fog-authoritative server is the real answer for high-stakes play.

**Performance as anti-cheat.** Our tick-time targets (< 10ms on 8-core desktop) mean the relay server can run games at full speed with headroom for behavioral analysis. Stuttery servers with 40ms ticks can't afford real-time order analysis — we can.
