## Save Game Format

Save games store a complete `SimSnapshot` — the entire sim state at a single tick, sufficient to restore the game exactly.

### Structure

```
iron_curtain_save_v1.icsave  (file extension: .icsave)
├── Header (fixed-size, uncompressed)
├── Metadata (JSON, uncompressed)
└── Payload (serde-serialized SimSnapshot, LZ4-compressed)
```

### Header (68 bytes, fixed)

All header fields use **little-endian** byte order and are **packed with no padding** (`#[repr(C, packed)]` in Rust, or equivalent sequential layout). Parsers must read fields at their exact byte offsets. This is the wire format — implementations in other languages read the same bytes in the same order.

```rust
pub struct SaveHeader {
    pub magic: [u8; 4],              // b"ICSV" — "Iron Curtain Save"
    pub version: u16,                // Serialization format version (1 = bincode, 2 = postcard)
    pub compression_algorithm: u8,   // D063: 0x01 = LZ4 (current), 0x02 reserved for zstd in a later format revision
    pub flags: u8,                   // Bit flags (has_thumbnail, etc.) — repacked from u16 (D063)
    pub metadata_offset: u32,        // Byte offset to metadata section
    pub metadata_length: u32,        // Metadata section length
    pub payload_offset: u32,         // Byte offset to compressed payload
    pub payload_length: u32,         // Compressed payload length
    pub uncompressed_length: u32,    // Uncompressed payload length (for pre-allocation)
    pub state_hash: u64,             // SyncHash of the saved tick (fast integrity check on load)
    pub payload_hash: [u8; 32],      // StateHash — SHA-256 over the compressed payload bytes.
                                     // Verified BEFORE decompression/deserialization (Fossilize pattern).
                                     // See api-misuse-defense.md S4 for the verification flow.
}
// Total: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 32 = 68 bytes
```

> **Compression (D063):** The `compression_algorithm` byte identifies which decompressor to use for the payload. Version 1 files use `0x01` (LZ4). The `version` field controls the serialization format (bincode vs. postcard) independently — see `decisions/09d/D054-extended-switchability.md` for codec dispatch and `decisions/09a-foundation.md` § D063 for algorithm dispatch. Compression level (fastest/balanced/compact) is configurable via `settings.toml` `compression.save_level` and affects encoding speed/ratio but not the format.

> **Security (V42):** Shared `.icsave` files are an attack surface. Enforce: max decompressed size 64 MB, JSON metadata cap 1 MB, schema validation of deserialized `SimSnapshot` (entity count, position bounds, valid components). Save directory sandboxed via `strict-path` `PathBoundary`. See `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 42.

### Metadata (JSON)

Human-readable metadata for the save browser UI. Stored as JSON (not the binary sim format) so the client can display save info without deserializing the full snapshot.

```json
{
  "save_name": "Allied Mission 5 - Checkpoint",
  "timestamp": "2027-03-15T14:30:00Z",
  "engine_version": "0.5.0",

  "active_mods": [
    { "id": "base-ra1", "version": "1.0.0" }
  ],
  "map_name": "Allied05.oramap",
  "tick": 18432,
  "game_time_seconds": 1228.8,

    "mission_id": "allied05",
    "flags": { "bridge_intact": true, "tanya_alive": true }
  },
  "thumbnail": "thumbnail.png"
}
```

### Payload

The payload is a `SimSnapshot` serialized via `serde` (bincode format for compactness) and compressed with LZ4 (fast decompression, good ratio for game state data). LZ4 was chosen over LZO (used by original RA) for its better Rust ecosystem support (`lz4_flex` crate) and superior decompression speed. The save file header's `version` field selects the serialization codec — version `1` uses bincode; version `2` is reserved for postcard if introduced under D054's migration/codec-dispatch path. The `compression_algorithm` byte selects the decompressor independently (D063). Compression level is configurable via `settings.toml` (`compression.save_level`: fastest/balanced/compact). See `decisions/09d/D054-extended-switchability.md` for the serialization version-to-codec dispatch and `decisions/09a-foundation.md` § D063 for the compression strategy.

    pub tick: u64,
    pub game_seed: u64,                  // game seed (for cross-game restore rejection — see api-misuse-defense.md S3)

}

/// plus external state collected from `ic-script` (script state) and the

/// files and replay keyframes. `ic-sim` never produces this directly.
pub struct SimSnapshot {
    pub core: SimCoreSnapshot,                  // Sim-internal state (produced by ic-sim)
    pub campaign_state: Option<CampaignState>,  // D021 branching state (collected by ic-game)
    pub script_state: Option<ScriptState>,      // Lua/WASM variable snapshots (collected by ic-game via ic-script)
}

/// Serializable snapshot of all active script state.
/// This is the *data* extracted from Lua/WASM runtimes — not the VM handles
/// themselves. On save, `ic-game` (the integration layer) calls each mod's

/// into this struct, then attaches it to the `SimSnapshot` before persisting.
/// On load, `on_deserialize()` restores them into a freshly initialized VM.
/// This preserves the crate boundary: `ic-sim` never imports `ic-script`.
pub struct ScriptState {
    /// Per-mod Lua variable snapshots (mod_id → serialized table).
    /// Each mod’s `on_serialize()` returns a Lua table; the engine
    /// serializes it to MessagePack bytes. `on_deserialize()` receives
    /// the same bytes and restores the table.
    pub lua_states: BTreeMap<ModId, Vec<u8>>,
    /// Per-mod WASM linear memory snapshots (mod_id → memory bytes).
    /// Only the mod's declared persistent memory region is captured,
    /// not the entire WASM linear memory. Mods declare persistent
    /// size via `[persistence] bytes = N` in their manifest.
    pub wasm_states: BTreeMap<ModId, Vec<u8>>,
    /// Global mission/campaign variables set via `Var.Set()` (Lua)
    /// or `ic_var_set()` (WASM host fn). These are engine-managed,
    /// not mod-managed — they survive mod version changes.
    pub mission_vars: BTreeMap<String, ScriptValue>,
}

/// Script-layer value type for mission variables.
/// Deliberately minimal — complex state belongs in mod-managed
/// Lua tables or WASM memory, not in engine-managed variables.
pub enum ScriptValue {
    Bool(bool),
    Int(i64),
    Fixed(FixedPoint),
    Str(String),
}
```

**Size estimate:** A 500-unit game snapshot is ~200KB uncompressed, ~40-80KB compressed. Well within "instant save/load" territory.

### Compatibility

Save files embed `engine_version` and `mod_api_version`. Loading a save from an older engine version triggers the migration path (if migration exists) or shows a compatibility warning. Save files are forward-compatible within the same `mod_api` major version.

**Platform note:** On WASM (browser), saves go to OPFS (primary) or IndexedDB (fallback) via Bevy's platform-appropriate storage — see `05-FORMATS.md` § Browser Asset Storage for the full tier hierarchy. On mobile, saves go to the app sandbox. The format is identical — only the storage backend differs.

## Replay File Format

Replays store the complete order stream — every player command, every tick — sufficient to reproduce an entire game by re-simulating from a known initial state.

```

> **Compression (D063):** The `compression_algorithm` byte identifies which decompressor to use for the tick order stream and embedded keyframe snapshots. Version 1 files use `0x01` (LZ4). Compression level during live recording defaults to `fastest` (configurable via `settings.toml` `compression.replay_level`). Use `ic replay recompress` to re-encode at a higher compression level for archival. See `decisions/09a-foundation.md` § D063.

The `flags` field bits:
- Bit 0: `SIGNED` — Ed25519 signature chain present (`signature_offset`/`signature_length` are valid)
- Bit 1: `HAS_EVENTS` — analysis event stream present (`events_offset`/`events_length` are valid)
- Bit 3: `HAS_VOICE` — per-player Opus audio tracks recorded with player consent (`voice_offset`/`voice_length` are valid; see `decisions/09g/D059-communication.md`)
- Bit 4: `INCOMPLETE` — one or more tick frames were lost during recording (see `lost_frame_count`). Replay is playable but not ranked-verifiable — the Ed25519 signature chain has gaps (V45). Set by `BackgroundReplayWriter` when `lost_frame_count > 0` at flush time.

**Section presence convention:** Each optional section has an `_offset`/`_length` pair in the header. A section is present when its corresponding flag bit is set AND its offset is non-zero. Readers must check the flag bit, not just the offset, to distinguish "section absent" from "section at offset 0" (impossible in practice since offset 0 is the header, but the flag is the canonical indicator). Embedded resources and keyframes have no flag bit — keyframes are mandatory (always present), and embedded resource presence is determined solely by `embedded_offset != 0`.

}
```

**Replay versioning** (following SC2's dual-version scheme): `base_build` identifies the protocol/serialization format version (matches the binary header's `version` field — used to select the correct deserializer). `data_version` is a SHA-256 hash of the game rules state (unit stats, weapon tables, balance preset) at recording time. A replay is playable if the engine supports its `base_build` protocol, even if the game data has changed between versions — the sim loads rules matching the `data_version` hash (from embedded resources or local cache).

### Data Minimization (Privacy)

Replay metadata and order streams contain **only gameplay-relevant data**. The following are explicitly excluded from `.icrep` files:

- **Hardware identifiers:** No GPU model, CPU model, RAM size, display resolution, or OS version
- **Network identifiers:** No player IP addresses, MAC addresses, or connection fingerprints
- **System telemetry:** No frame times, local performance metrics, or diagnostic data (these live in the local SQLite database per D034, not in replays)
- **File paths:** No local filesystem paths (mod install directories, asset cache locations, etc.)

This is a lesson from BAR/Recoil, whose replay format accumulated hardware fingerprinting data that created privacy concerns when replays were shared publicly. IC's replay format is deliberately minimal: the metadata JSON above is the complete set of fields. Any future metadata additions must pass a privacy review — "would sharing this replay on a public forum leak personally identifying information?"

Player names in replays are display names (D053), not account identifiers. Anonymization is possible via `ic replay anonymize` which replaces player names with generic labels ("Player 1", "Player 2") for educational sharing.

### Tick Order Stream

The order stream is a sequence of per-tick frames:

```rust
/// One tick's worth of orders in the replay.
pub struct ReplayTickFrame {
    pub tick: u64,
    pub state_hash: u64,                // SyncHash — fast desync detection during playback (see type-safety.md)
    pub orders: Vec<TimestampedOrder>,   // all player orders this tick
}
```

Frames are serialized with bincode and compressed in blocks (LZ4 block compression): every 256 ticks form a compression block. This enables seeking — jump to any 256-tick boundary by decompressing just that block, then fast-forward within the block.

**Streaming write:** During a live game, replay frames are appended incrementally (not buffered in memory). The replay file is valid at any point — if the game crashes, the replay up to that point is usable.

### Keyframe Index & Snapshots

Periodic `SimSnapshot` or `DeltaSnapshot` captures that enable fast seeking without re-simulating from tick 0. Keyframes are **mandatory** — every 300 ticks (~20 seconds at the Slower default). Full/delta alternation bounds worst-case seek cost to one full snapshot + 9 deltas. For the complete type definitions (`KeyframeIndexEntry`, `DeltaSnapshot`, `SimCoreDelta`, `EntityDelta`, `PlayerStateDelta`, `MapStateDelta`, `StringInternerSnapshot/Delta`) and the seeking algorithm, see [Replay Keyframes & Analysis Events](replay-keyframes-analysis.md) § Keyframe Index & Snapshots.

### Analysis Event Stream

SC2-inspired analytical data stream sampled during recording — enables stats sites, tournament review, and coaching tools to extract rich data without re-simulating. 18 event types covering unit lifecycle, economy, camera tracking, selection/control groups, abilities, votes, and match structure. For the full `AnalysisEvent` enum, competitive analysis rationale, and compression details, see [Replay Keyframes & Analysis Events](replay-keyframes-analysis.md) § Analysis Event Stream.

### Signature Chain (Relay-Certified Replays)

For ranked/tournament matches, the relay server signs state hashes at signing cadence (every N ticks, default 30 — see `network-model-trait.md`), producing a `TickSignature` chain. The chain is sparse — not every tick has a signature, only those at signing cadence boundaries. The signature algorithm is determined by the replay header version — version `1` uses Ed25519 (current). Later replay header versions, if introduced, may select post-quantum algorithms via the `SignatureScheme` enum (D054) while preserving versioned verification dispatch:

```rust
pub struct ReplaySignature {
    pub chain: Vec<TickSignature>,
    pub relay_public_key: Ed25519PublicKey,
}

pub struct TickSignature {
    pub tick: u64,
    pub state_hash: StateHash,    // Full SHA-256 — relay receives StateHash at signing cadence (see network-model-trait.md)
    /// Number of ticks skipped before this one (0 = contiguous, >0 = gap due to
    /// BackgroundReplayWriter frame loss — see V45). Verifiers include the gap
    /// count in the hash chain: `hash(prev_sig_hash, skipped_ticks, tick, state_hash)`.
    pub skipped_ticks: u32,
    pub relay_sig: Ed25519Signature,  // relay signs (skipped_ticks, tick, hash, prev_sig_hash)
}
```

The signature chain is a linked hash chain — each signature includes the hash of the previous signature. Tampering with any tick invalidates all subsequent signatures. Only relay-hosted games produce signed replays. Unsigned replays are fully functional for playback — signatures add trust, not capability.

**Match-end closure:** The relay always emits a final `TickSignature` for the terminal tick of the match, regardless of whether it falls on a signing cadence boundary. This ensures the signature chain covers the complete match — there is no unsigned tail between the last regular cadence boundary and the actual final tick. The `ReplayHeader.final_state_hash` (a `StateHash`, not a truncated `SyncHash`) matches the `state_hash` in this terminal `TickSignature` entry, providing a quick integrity check without scanning the full chain.

**Selective tick verification via Merkle paths:** When the sim uses Merkle tree state hashing (see `03-NETCODE.md` § Merkle Tree State Hashing), each `TickSignature` can include the Merkle root rather than a flat hash. This enables **selective verification at signing cadence boundaries**: a tournament official can verify that a signed tick (e.g., tick 5,100 at cadence=30) is authentic without replaying from the start — just by checking the Merkle path from that tick's root to the signature chain. For ticks between signing boundaries (e.g., tick 5,017), verification requires replaying deterministically from the nearest preceding signed tick (tick 5,010 at cadence=30) — 7 ticks of re-simulation, not the full game. The signature chain itself forms a hash chain (each entry includes the previous entry's hash), so verifying any single signed tick also proves the integrity of the chain up to that point. This is the same principle as SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) in Bitcoin — prove a specific item belongs to a signed set without downloading the full set. Useful for dispute resolution ("did this specific moment really happen?") with at most one cadence interval of re-simulation.

### Embedded Resources (Self-Contained Replays)

A frequent complaint in RTS replay communities is that replays become unplayable when a required mod or map version is unavailable. 0 A.D. and Warzone 2100 both suffer from this — replays reference external map files by name/hash, and if the map is missing, the replay is dead (see `research/0ad-warzone2100-netcode-analysis.md`).

IC replays can optionally embed the resources needed for playback directly in the `.icrep` file:

```rust
/// Optional embedded resources section. When present, the replay is
/// self-contained — playable without the original mod/map installed.
pub struct EmbeddedResources {
    pub map_data: Option<Vec<u8>>,           // Complete map file (LZ4-compressed)
    pub mod_manifest: Option<ModManifest>,    // Mod versions + rule snapshots
    pub balance_preset: Option<String>,       // Which balance preset was active
    pub initial_state: Option<Vec<u8>>,       // Full sim snapshot at tick 0
}
```

**Embedding modes** (determined by `embedded_offset`/`embedded_length` in the header and the content of the `EmbeddedResources` struct):

| Mode            | Map                 | Mod Rules           | Size Impact | Use Case                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Minimal`       | Hash reference only | Version IDs only    | +0 KB       | Normal replays (mods installed locally)      |
| `MapEmbedded`   | Full map data       | Version IDs only    | +50-200 KB  | Sharing replays of custom maps               |
| `SelfContained` | Full map data       | Rule YAML snapshots | +200-500 KB | Tournament archives, historical preservation |

**Tournament archives** use `SelfContained` mode — a replay from 2028 remains playable in 2035 even if the mod has been updated 50 times. The embedded rule snapshots are read-only and cannot override locally installed mods during normal play.

**Size trade-off:** A `Minimal` replay for a 60-minute game is ~2-5 MB (order stream + signatures). A `SelfContained` replay adds ~200-500 KB for embedded resources — a small overhead for permanent playability. Maps larger than 1 MB (rare) use external references instead of embedding.

> **Security (V41):** `SelfContained` embedded resources bypass Workshop moderation and publisher trust tiers. Mitigations: consent prompt before loading embedded content from unknown sources, Lua/WASM never embedded (map data and rule YAML only), diff display against installed mod version, extraction sandboxed via `strict-path` `PathBoundary`. See `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 41.

### Playback

`ReplayPlayback` implements the `NetworkModel` trait. It reads the tick order stream and feeds orders to the sim as if they came from the network:

```rust
impl NetworkModel for ReplayPlayback {
    fn poll_tick(&mut self) -> Option<TickOrders> {
        let frame: ReplayTickFrame = self.read_next_frame()?;

        // Verify state hash against the sim's current state.
        // On mismatch: desync detected — playback has diverged.
        if let Some(sim_hash) = self.last_sim_hash {
            if sim_hash != frame.state_hash {
                self.on_desync(frame.tick, sim_hash, frame.state_hash);
            }
        }

        // Convert Vec<TimestampedOrder> into TickOrders for the sim.
        Some(TickOrders {
            tick: frame.tick,
            orders: frame.orders,
        })
    }
}
```

**Hash verification timing:** The `state_hash` in each `ReplayTickFrame` is the sim's state hash *after* the previous tick executed. `ReplayPlayback` records the sim's `state_hash()` after each `step()` call (via callback or polling) and verifies it against the next frame's `state_hash`. A mismatch means the local sim has diverged from the recorded game — this triggers a desync warning in the UI (not a crash). For foreign replays (D056), divergence is expected and tracked by `DivergenceTracker`.

**Playback features:** Variable speed (0.5x to 8x), pause, scrub to any tick (re-simulates from nearest keyframe). The recorder writes a keyframe every 300 ticks (~20 seconds at the Slower default of ~15 tps): most keyframes are `DeltaSnapshot`s relative to the preceding full snapshot, with a full `SimSnapshot` keyframe every 3000 ticks (every 10th keyframe). A 60-minute replay at Slower speed contains ~180 keyframes (~3–6 MB overhead depending on game state size), enabling sub-second seeking to any point. Keyframes are mandatory — the recorder always writes them.

**Keyframe serialization threading:** Producing a replay keyframe involves three phases with different thread and crate requirements:

1. **Sim core delta** (game thread, `ic-sim`): `Simulation::delta_snapshot(baseline)` reads ECS state and intern table changes via `ChangeMask` iteration, where `baseline` is the `StateRecorder`'s `last_full_snapshot` (see `state-recording.md`). This MUST run on the game thread because it reads live sim state. Cost: ~0.5–1 ms for 500 units (lightweight — bitfield scan + changed component serialization). Produces a `SimCoreDelta`.
2. **External state collection** (game thread, `ic-game`): `ic-game` compares current campaign/script state against the `StateRecorder`'s `last_campaign_state` / `last_script_state` baselines (see `state-recording.md`). Campaign state is a small struct (flags + mission ID) — trivial copy. Script state collection calls `ic-script`'s `on_serialize()` callbacks for each active mod's Lua/WASM state. Cost: ~0.1–0.5 ms depending on mod count and state size. `ic-game` composes the full `DeltaSnapshot { core, campaign_state, script_state }` — including `campaign_state` / `script_state` only if they changed since the respective baselines — serializes it to `Vec<u8>`, and passes the blob to `BackgroundReplayWriter::record_keyframe()` (see `network-model-trait.md` § Background Replay Writer).
3. **LZ4 compression + file write** (background writer thread): The serialized bytes are sent through the replay writer's crossbeam channel to the background thread, which performs LZ4 compression (~0.3–0.5 ms for ~200 KB → ~40–80 KB) and appends to the `.icrep` file. File I/O never touches the game thread.

The game thread contributes ~1–1.5 ms every 300 ticks (~20 seconds at Slower default) for keyframe production — well within the 67 ms tick budget (Slower default). The LZ4 compression and disk write happen asynchronously on the background writer. Full `SimSnapshot` keyframes (every 3000 ticks) cost more (~2–3 ms game thread) because they serialize all entities rather than just changed components.

### Foreign Replay Decoders (D056)

`ra-formats` includes decoders for foreign replay file formats, enabling direct playback and conversion to `.icrep`:

| Format                | Extension                      | Structure                                                        | Decoder                   | Source Documentation                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenRA                | `.orarep`                      | ZIP archive (order stream + `metadata.yaml` + `sync.bin`)        | `OpenRAReplayDecoder`     | OpenRA source: `ReplayUtils.cs`, `ReplayConnection.cs`              |
| Remastered Collection | Binary (no standard extension) | `Save_Recording_Values()` header + per-frame `EventClass` DoList | `RemasteredReplayDecoder` | EA GPL source: `QUEUE.CPP` §§ `Queue_Record()` / `Queue_Playback()` |

Both decoders produce a `ForeignReplay` struct (defined in `decisions/09f/D056-replay-import.md`) — a normalized intermediate representation with `ForeignFrame` / `ForeignOrder` types. This IR is translated to IC's `TimestampedOrder` by `ForeignReplayCodec` in `ic-protocol`, then fed to either `ForeignReplayPlayback` (direct viewing) or the `ic replay import` CLI (conversion to `.icrep`).

**Remastered replay header** (from `Save_Recording_Values()` in `REDALERT/INIT.CPP`):

```rust
/// Header fields written by Save_Recording_Values().
/// Parsed by RemasteredReplayDecoder.
pub struct RemasteredReplayHeader {
    pub session: SessionValues,       // MaxAhead, FrameSendRate, DesiredFrameRate
    pub build_level: u32,
    pub debug_unshroud: bool,
    pub random_seed: u32,             // Deterministic replay seed
    pub scenario: [u8; 44],           // Scenario identifier
    pub scenario_name: [u8; 44],
    pub whom: u32,                    // Player perspective
    pub special: SpecialFlags,
    pub options: GameOptions,
}
```

**Remastered per-frame format** (from `Queue_Record()` in `QUEUE.CPP`):

```rust
/// Per-frame recording: count of events, then that many EventClass structs.
/// Each EventClass is a fixed-size C struct (sizeof(EventClass) bytes).
pub struct RemasteredRecordedFrame {
    pub event_count: u32,
    pub events: Vec<RemasteredEventClass>,  // event_count entries
}
```

**OpenRA `.orarep` structure:**

```
game.orarep (ZIP archive)
├── metadata.yaml          # MiniYAML: players, map, mod, version, outcome
├── orders                  # Binary order stream (per-tick Order objects)
└── sync                    # Per-tick state hashes (u64 CRC values)
```

The `sync` stream enables partial divergence detection — IC can compare its own `state_hash()` against OpenRA's recorded sync values to estimate when the simulations diverged.
