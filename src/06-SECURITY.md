# Security & Threat Model

> **Keywords:** threat model, vulnerabilities, anti-cheat, maphack, replay signing, WASM sandbox, transport encryption, Workshop supply chain, ranked integrity, path traversal, competitive integrity

Iron Curtain's security is architectural — every defense emerges from design decisions made for other reasons. This chapter catalogs 60 vulnerabilities (V1–V60) with concrete mitigations, cross-referenced to the design decisions that prevent them.
