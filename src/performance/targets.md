## Performance vs. C# RTS Engines (Projected)

*These are projected comparisons based on architectural analysis, not benchmarks. C# numbers are estimates for a typical C#/.NET single-threaded game loop with GC.*

| What                 | Typical C# RTS (e.g., OpenRA)                   | Our Engine                                   | Why                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 500 unit tick        | Estimated 30-60ms (single thread + GC spikes)   | ~8ms (algorithmic + cache)                   | Flowfields, spatial hash, ECS layout    |
| Memory per unit      | Estimated ~2-4KB (C# objects + GC metadata)     | ~200-400 bytes (ECS packed)                  | No GC metadata, no vtable, no boxing    |
| GC pause             | 5-50ms unpredictable spikes (C# characteristic) | 0ms (doesn't exist)                          | Rust ownership + zero-alloc hot paths   |
| Pathfinding 50 units | 50 × A* = ~2ms                                  | 1 flowfield + 50 lookups = ~0.1ms            | Algorithm change, not hardware change   |
| Memory fragmentation | Increases over game duration                    | Stable (pre-allocated pools)                 | Scratch buffers, no per-tick allocation |
| 2-core scaling       | 1x (single-threaded, verified for OpenRA)       | ~1.5x (work-stealing helps where applicable) | rayon adaptive                          |
| 8-core scaling       | 1x (single-threaded, verified for OpenRA)       | ~3-5x (diminishing returns on game logic)    | rayon work-stealing                     |

## Input Responsiveness vs. OpenRA

Beyond raw sim performance, input responsiveness is where players *feel* the difference. OpenRA's TCP lockstep model (verified: single-threaded game loop, static `OrderLatency`, all clients wait for slowest) freezes all players to wait for the slowest connection. Our relay model never stalls — late orders are dropped, not waited for.

*OpenRA numbers below are estimates based on architectural analysis of their source code, not benchmarks.*

| Factor                      | OpenRA (estimated)            | Iron Curtain                 | Why Faster                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Waiting for slowest client  | Yes — everyone freezes        | No — relay drops late orders | Relay owns the clock                      |
| Order batching interval     | Every N frames (configurable) | Every tick                   | Higher tick rate makes N=1 viable         |
| Tick processing time        | Estimated 30-60ms             | ~8ms                         | Algorithmic efficiency                    |
| Achievable tick rate        | ~15 tps                       | 30+ tps                      | 4x shorter lockstep window                |
| GC pauses during tick       | 5-50ms (C# characteristic)    | 0ms                          | Rust, zero-allocation                     |
| Visual feedback on click    | Waits for confirmation        | Immediate (cosmetic)         | Render-side prediction, no sim dependency |
| Single-player order delay   | ~66ms (1 projected frame)     | ~33ms (next tick at 30 tps)  | `LocalNetwork` = zero scheduling delay    |
| Worst-case MP click-to-move | Estimated 200-400ms           | 80-120ms (relay deadline)    | Fixed deadline, no hostage-taking         |

**Combined effect:** A single-player click-to-move that takes ~200ms in OpenRA (order latency + tick time + potential GC jank) should take ~33ms in Iron Curtain — imperceptible to human reaction time. Multiplayer improves from "at the mercy of the worst connection" to a fixed, predictable deadline.
