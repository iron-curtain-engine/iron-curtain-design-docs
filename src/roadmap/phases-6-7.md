## Phase 6a: Core Modding & Scenario Editor (Months 26–30)

**Goal:** Ship the modding SDK, core scenario editor, and full Workshop — the three pillars that enable community content creation.

> **Phased Workshop delivery (D030):** A minimal Workshop (central server + `ic mod publish` + `ic mod install` + in-game browser + auto-download on lobby join) should ship during Phase 4–5 alongside the `ic` CLI. Phase 6a adds the full Artifactory-level features: federation, community servers, replication, promotion channels, CI/CD token scoping, creator reputation, DMCA process. This avoids holding Workshop infrastructure hostage until month 26.

### Deliverables — Modding SDK
- Full OpenRA YAML rule compatibility (existing mods load)
- WASM mod scripting with full capability system
- Asset hot-reloading for mod development
- Mod manager + workshop-style distribution
- Tera templating for YAML generation (nice-to-have)
- **`ic` CLI tool (full release):** `ic mod init/check/test/run/server/package/publish/watch/lint` plus Git-first helpers (`ic git setup`, `ic content diff`) — complete mod development workflow (D020)
- **Mod templates:** `data-mod`, `scripted-mod`, `total-conversion`, `map-pack`, `asset-pack` via `ic mod init`
- **`mod.toml` manifest** with typed schema, semver engine version pinning, dependency declarations
- **VS Code extension** for mod development: YAML schema validation, Lua LSP, `ic` integration

### Deliverables — Scenario Editor (D038 Core)
- **SDK scenario editor (D038):** OFP/Eden-inspired visual editor for maps AND mission logic — ships as part of the IC SDK (separate application from the game — D040). Terrain painting, unit placement, triggers (area-based with countdown/timeout timers and min/mid/max randomization), waypoints, pre-built modules (wave spawner, patrol route, guard position, reinforcements, objectives, weather change, time of day, day/night cycle, season, etc.), visual connection lines between triggers/modules/waypoints, Probability of Presence per entity for replayability, compositions (reusable prefabs), layers with lock/visibility, Simple/Advanced mode toggle, **Preview/Test/Validate/Publish** toolbar flow, autosave with crash recovery, undo/redo, direct Workshop publishing
- **Resource stacks (D038):** Ordered media candidates with per-entry conditions and fallback chains — every media property (video, audio, music, portrait) supports stacking. External streaming URIs (YouTube, Spotify, Google Drive) as optional stack entries with mandatory local fallbacks. Workshop publish validation enforces fallback presence.
- **Environment panel (D038):** Consolidated time/weather/atmosphere setup — clock dial for time of day, day/night cycle toggle with speed slider, weather dropdown with D022 state machine editor, temperature, wind, ambient light, fog style. Live preview in editor viewport.
- **Achievement Trigger module (D036/D038):** Connects achievements to the visual trigger system — no Lua required for standard achievement unlock logic
- **Editor vocabulary schema:** Auto-generated machine-readable description of all modules, triggers, compositions, templates, and properties — powers documentation, mod tooling, and the Phase 7 Editor AI Assistant
- **Git-first collaboration support (D038):** Stable content IDs + canonical serialization for editor-authored files, read-only Git status strip (branch/dirty/conflicts), `ic git setup` repo-local helpers, `ic content diff` semantic diff viewer/CLI. **No commit/branch/push/pull UI in the SDK** (Git remains the source of truth).
- **Validate & Playtest workflow (D038):** Quick Validate and Publish Validate presets, async/cancelable validation runs, status badges (`Valid/Warnings/Errors/Stale/Running`), and a single Publish Readiness screen aggregating validation/export/license/metadata warnings
- **Profile Playtest v1 (D038):** Advanced-mode only performance profiling from `Test` dropdown with summary-first output (avg/max tick time, top hotspots, low-end target budget comparison)
- **Migration Workbench v1 (D038 + D020):** "Upgrade Project" flow in SDK (read-only migration preview/report wrapper over `ic mod migrate`)
- **Resource Manager panel (D038):** Unified resource browser with three tiers — Default (game module assets indexed from `.mix` archives, always available), Workshop (inline browsing/search/install from D030), Local (drag-and-drop / file import into project `assets/`); drag-to-editor workflow for all resource types; cross-tier search; duplicate detection; inline preview (sprites, audio playback, palette swatches, video thumbnails); format conversion on import via `ic-cnc-content`

## Phase 7: AI Content, Ecosystem & Polish (Months 34–36+)

**Goal:** Optional LLM-generated missions (BYOLLM), visual modding infrastructure, ecosystem polish, and feature parity.

### Deliverables — AI Content Generation (Optional — BYOLLM)

All LLM features require the player to configure their own LLM provider. The game is fully functional without one.

- `ic-llm` crate: optional LLM integration for mission generation
- In-game mission generator UI: describe scenario → playable mission
- Generated output: standard YAML map + Lua trigger scripts + briefing text
- Difficulty scaling: same scenario at different challenge levels
- Mission sharing: rate, remix, publish generated missions
- Campaign generation: connected multi-mission storylines (experimental)
- **World Domination campaign mode (D016):** LLM-driven narrative across a world map; world map renderer in `ic-ui` (region overlays, faction colors, frontline animation, briefing panel); mission generation from campaign state; template fallback without LLM; strategic AI for non-player WD factions; per-region force pool and garrison management
- **Template fallback system (D016):** Built-in mission templates per terrain type and action type (urban assault, rural defense, naval landing, arctic recon, mountain pass, etc.); template selection from strategic state; force pool population; deterministic progression rules for no-LLM mode
- Adaptive difficulty: AI observes playstyle, generates targeted challenges (experimental)
- **LLM-driven Workshop resource discovery (D030):** When LLM provider is configured, LLM can search Workshop by `llm_meta` tags, evaluate fitness, auto-pull resources as dependencies for generated content; license-aware filtering
- **LLM player-aware generation (D034):** When LLM provider is configured, `ic-llm` reads local SQLite for player context — faction preferences, unit usage patterns, win/loss streaks, campaign roster state; generates personalized missions, adaptive briefings, post-match commentary, coaching suggestions, rivalry narratives
- **LLM coaching loop (D042):** When LLM provider is configured, `ic-llm` reads `training_sessions` + `player_profiles` for structured training plans ("Week 1: expansion timing"), post-session natural language coaching, multi-session arc tracking, and contextual tips during weakness review; builds on Phase 4–5 rule-based training system
- **AI training data pipeline (D031):** replay-first extraction — deterministic replay files → fog-filtered TrainingPair conversion → Parquet export; telemetry enrichment (gameplay events, input patterns, pacing snapshots) as secondary signals; build order learning, engagement patterns, balance analysis; see `research/ml-training-pipeline-design.md`
- **LLM audio generation — music & SFX (D016):** Self-contained ABC→MIDI→SoundFont pipeline: Phi-4-mini generates ABC notation, IC's clean-room ABC parser converts to MIDI, `rustysynth` renders through bundled SoundFont (GeneralUser GS ~30 MB) to OGG/WAV; covers both 5-mood dynamic music tracks and short SFX (weapon sounds, UI feedback, ability stingers, ambient); `AudioGenerator` orchestrates prompt→ABC→MIDI→SoundFont→audio; D016 mission generation gains optional audio step (unique soundtrack + custom SFX per generated mission); validation pipeline (5 checks for music, 3 for SFX) + retry on failure; see `research/llm-soundtrack-generation-design.md`
- **Demoscene-inspired parameter synthesis (optional, D016):** Lightweight `!synth` YAML tag for procedural SFX defined as parameter schemas (~50–150 values) rendered to PCM at load time; ~500–1,000 lines of Rust in `ic-audio`; complements ABC→MIDI→SoundFont for noise-based/electronic SFX (explosions, lasers, impacts); LLM generates JSON parameter objects (~20–50 tokens per patch); see `research/demoscene-synthesizer-analysis.md`

### Deliverables — WASM Editor Plugins & Community Export Targets (D066)
- **WASM editor plugins (D066 Tier 3):** Full editor plugins via WASM — custom asset viewers, terrain tools, component editors, export targets; `EditorHost` API for plugin registration; community-contributed export targets for Tiberian Sun, RA2, Remastered Collection
- **Agentic export assistance (D066/D016):** When LLM provider is configured, LLM suggests how to simplify IC-only features for target compatibility; auto-generates fidelity-improving alternatives for flagged triggers/features

### Deliverables — Visual Modding Infrastructure (Bevy Rendering)

These are optional visual enhancements that ship as engine capabilities for modders and community content creators. The base game uses the classic isometric aesthetic established in Phase 1.

- Post-processing pipeline available to modders: bloom, color grading, ambient occlusion
- Dynamic lighting infrastructure: explosions, muzzle flash, day/night cycle (optional game mode)
- GPU particle system infrastructure: smoke trails, fire propagation, weather effects (rain, snow, sandstorm, fog, blizzard, storm — see `04-MODDING.md` § "weather scene template")
- Weather system: per-map or trigger-based, render-only or with optional sim effects (visibility, speed modifiers)
- Shader effect library: chrono-shift, iron curtain, gap generator, nuke flash
- Cinematic replay camera with smooth interpolation

### Deliverables — Ecosystem Polish (deferred from Phase 6b)

- **Community governance tooling (D037):** Workshop moderator dashboard, community representative election system, game module steward roles
- **Editor AI Assistant (D038):** Copilot-style AI-powered editor assistant — `EditorAssistant` trait (defined in Phase 6a) + `ic-llm` implementation; natural language prompts → editor actions (place entities, create triggers, build campaign graphs, configure intermissions); ghost preview before execution; full undo/redo integration; context-aware suggestions based on current editor state; prompt pattern library for scenario, campaign, and media tasks; discoverable capability hints
- **Editor onboarding:** "Coming From" profiles (OFP/AoE2/StarCraft/WC3), keybinding presets, terminology Rosetta Stone, interactive migration cheat sheets, partial scenario import from other editors
- **Game accessibility:** colorblind faction/minimap/resource palettes, screen reader support for menus, remappable controls, subtitle options for EVA/briefings

### Deliverables — Platform
- Feature parity checklist vs OpenRA
- Web build via WASM (play in browser)
- Mobile touch controls
