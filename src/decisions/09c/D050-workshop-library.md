## D050: Workshop as Cross-Project Reusable Library

**Decision:** The Workshop core (registry, distribution, federation, P2P) is designed as a **standalone, engine-agnostic, game-agnostic Rust library** that Iron Curtain is the first consumer of, with the explicit intent that future game projects (XCOM-inspired tactics clone, Civilization-inspired 4X clone, Operation Flashpoint/ArmA-inspired military sim) will be additional consumers. These future projects may or may not use Bevy — the Workshop library must not depend on any specific game engine.

**Rationale:**
- The author plans to build multiple open-source game clones in the spirit of OpenRA, each targeting a different genre's community. Every one of these projects faces the same Workshop problem: mod distribution, versioning, dependencies, integrity, community hosting, P2P delivery
- Building Workshop infrastructure once and reusing it across projects amortizes the significant design and engineering investment over multiple games
- An XCOM clone needs soldier mods, ability packs, map presets, voice packs. A Civ clone needs civilization packs, map scripts, leader art, scenario bundles. An OFP/ArmA clone needs terrains (often 5–20 GB), vehicle models, weapon packs, mission scripts, campaign packages. All of these are "versioned packages with metadata, dependencies, and integrity verification" — the same core abstraction
- The P2P distribution layer is especially valuable for the ArmA-style project where mod sizes routinely exceed what any free CDN can sustain
- Making the library engine-agnostic also produces cleaner IC code — the Bevy integration layer is thinner, better tested, and easier to maintain

### Three-Layer Architecture

The Workshop is split into three layers with clean boundaries. The bottom layer (`p2p-distribute`) is a fundamental P2P content distribution engine that IC uses across multiple subsystems — not just Workshop. The middle layer (`workshop-core`) adds registry, federation, and package semantics. The top layer is per-project game integration.

**Why three layers, not two:** The original two-layer design bundled P2P distribution into `workshop-core`. In practice, IC uses P2P distribution in contexts that have nothing to do with the Workshop — replay sharing between players, game update delivery, lobby auto-download, live balance/config channels from community servers. Separating `p2p-distribute` as a standalone crate (D076 Tier 3) makes the P2P engine available to any IC subsystem (and to non-IC consumers like package managers, media tools, or IoT fleets) without pulling in Workshop registry semantics.

### Impact on Existing D030/D049 Design

The existing Workshop design requires only **architectural clarification**, not redesign. The core abstractions (packages, manifests, publishers, dependencies, federation, P2P) are already game-agnostic in concept. The changes are:

1. **Three-layer split**: P2P distribution moves from `workshop-core` into `p2p-distribute` (D076 Tier 3). `workshop-core` depends on `p2p-distribute` for transport. IC subsystems that need P2P without Workshop semantics (replay sharing, update delivery, live config channels) depend on `p2p-distribute` directly.

2. **Naming**: Where the design says `.icpkg`, the implementation will have a configurable extension with `.icpkg` as IC's default. Where it says `ic mod *`, the core library provides operations and IC wraps them as `ic mod *` subcommands.

3. **Categories**: Where D030 lists a fixed `ResourceCategory` enum (Music, Sprites, Maps...), the core library uses free-form tags. IC's integration layer provides a recommended tag vocabulary and UI groupings. Other projects provide their own.

4. **Manifest**: The `manifest.yaml` schema splits into core fields (in the library) and extension fields (per-project). `game_module: ra1` is an IC extension field, not a core manifest requirement.

5. **Format recommendations**: D049's Bevy-native format table is IC-specific guidance, not a core Workshop concern. The core library is format-agnostic. Each consuming project publishes its own format recommendations based on its engine's capabilities.

6. **P2P scoring**: The `LobbyContext` dimension in peer scoring becomes `ApplicationContext` — a generic callback where any project can inject context-aware peer prioritization. IC implements it as "same lobby = bonus." An ArmA-style project implements it as "same server = bonus."

7. **Infrastructure**: Domain names (`ironcurtain.gg`), GitHub org (`iron-curtain/`), tracker URLs — these are IC deployment configuration. The core library is configured via `sources.yaml` with no hardcoded URLs.

8. **Revocation**: The `RevocationPolicy` trait in `p2p-distribute` provides protocol-layer enforcement (stop transfers, de-announce). `workshop-core` adds federation-level revocation propagation — when one registry revokes a package, the revocation record is distributed to federated registries. IC's Workshop moderation decisions feed into `workshop-core`'s revocation system, which populates `p2p-distribute`'s block list.

### Cross-Project Infrastructure Sharing

While each project has its own Workshop deployment, sharing is possible:

- **Shared tracker**: A single BitTorrent tracker can serve multiple game projects. The info-hash namespace is naturally disjoint (different packages = different hashes).
- **Shared git-index hosting**: One GitHub org could host workshop-index repos for multiple projects.
- **Shared seed boxes**: Seed infrastructure can serve packages from multiple games simultaneously — BitTorrent doesn't care about content semantics.
- **Cross-project dependencies**: A music pack or shader effect could be published once and depended on by packages from multiple games. The identity system (`publisher/name@version`) is globally unique.
- **Shared federation network**: Community-hosted Workshop servers could participate in multiple games' federation networks simultaneously.

> **Also shared with IC's netcode infrastructure.** The tracking server, relay server, and Workshop server share deep structural parallels within IC itself — federation, heartbeats, rate control, connection management, observability, deployment principles. The cross-pollination analysis (`research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md` § "Netcode ↔ Workshop Cross-Pollination") identifies four shared infrastructure opportunities: a unified `ic-server` binary (tracking + relay + workshop in one process for small community operators), a shared federation library (multi-source aggregation used by both tracking and Workshop), a shared auth/identity layer (one Ed25519 keypair for multiplayer + publishing + profile), and shared scoring infrastructure (EWMA time-decaying reputation used by both P2P peer scoring and relay player quality tracking). The federation library and scoring infrastructure belong in `workshop-core` (D050) since they're already game-agnostic. The P2P engine itself (`p2p-distribute`) is even more fundamental — used by IC subsystems beyond Workshop (replay distribution, update delivery, live config channels).

### Engine-Agnostic P2P and Netcode

The P2P distribution protocol (BitTorrent/WebTorrent) and all the patterns adopted from Kraken, Dragonfly, and IPFS (see D049 competitive landscape and `research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md`) are **already engine-agnostic**. The protocol operates at the TCP/UDP level — it doesn't know or care whether the consuming application uses Bevy, Godot, Unreal, or a custom engine. The Rust implementation (`ic-workshop` core library) has no engine dependency.

For projects that use a non-Rust engine (unlikely given the author's preferences, but architecturally supported): the Workshop core library exposes a C FFI or can be compiled as a standalone process that the game communicates with via IPC/localhost HTTP. The CLI itself serves as a non-Rust integration path — any game engine can shell out to the Workshop CLI for install/update operations.

### Non-RTS Game Considerations

Each future genre introduces patterns the current design doesn't explicitly address:

| Genre                         | Key Workshop Differences                                                                                            | Already Handled                                                               | Needs Attention                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Turn-based tactics** (XCOM) | Smaller mod sizes, more code-heavy mods (abilities, AI), procedural map parameters                                  | Package format, dependencies, P2P                                             | Ability/behavior mods may need a scripting sandbox equivalent to IC's Lua/WASM — but that's a game concern, not a Workshop concern                                                                                                                |
| **Turn-based 4X** (Civ)       | Very large mod variety (civilizations, maps, scenarios, art), DLC-like mod structure, long-lived save compatibility | Package format, dependencies, versioning, P2P                                 | Save-game compatibility metadata (a Civ mod that changes game rules may break existing saves). Workshop manifest could include `breaks_saves: true` as an extension field                                                                         |
| **Military sim** (OFP/ArmA)   | Very large packages (terrains 5–20 GB), server-mandated mod lists, many simultaneous mods active                    | P2P (critical for large packages), dependencies, auto-download on server join | Partial downloads (download terrain mesh now, HD textures later) could benefit from sub-package granularity. Workshop packages already support dependencies — a terrain could be split into `base` + `hd-textures` + `satellite-imagery` packages |
| **Any**                       | Different scripting languages, different asset formats, different mod structures                                    | Core library is content-agnostic                                              | Nothing — this is the point of the three-layer design                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Phase

D050 is an architectural principle, not a deliverable with its own phase. It shapes HOW D030 and D049 are implemented:

- **IC Phase 3–4**: Implement `workshop-core` as a separate Rust library crate within the IC monorepo, depending on `p2p-distribute` (D076 Tier 3, already in its own repo). Both crates have zero Bevy dependencies. IC's Bevy plugin wraps `workshop-core`. The API boundary enforces the three-layer split from the start.
- **IC Phase 5–6**: `p2p-distribute` is already a standalone repo. If a second game project begins, `workshop-core` can be extracted to its own repo with minimal effort because the boundary was enforced from day one. IC subsystems that use P2P without Workshop (replay sharing, update delivery) depend on `p2p-distribute` directly.
- **Post-IC-launch**: Each new game project creates its own integration layer and deployment configuration. The P2P engine, Workshop core library, federation specification, and content channel protocol are shared.

### P003 — Audio System Design Notes

The audio system is the least-designed critical subsystem. Beyond the library choice, Phase 3 needs to resolve:

- **Original `.aud` playback and encoding:** Decoding and encoding Westwood's `.aud` format (IMA ADPCM, mono/stereo, 8/16-bit, varying sample rates). Full codec implementation based on EA GPL source — `AUDHeaderType` header, `IndexTable`/`DiffTable` lookup tables, 4-bit nibble processing. See `05-FORMATS.md` § AUD Audio Format for complete struct definitions and algorithm details. Encoding support enables the Asset Studio (D040) audio converter for .aud ↔ .wav/.ogg conversion
- **Music loading from Remastered Collection:** If the player owns the Remastered Collection, can IC load the remastered soundtrack? Licensing allows personal use of purchased files, but the integration path needs design
- **Dynamic music states:** Combat/build/idle transitions (original RA had this — "Act on Instinct" during combat, ambient during base building). State machine driven by sim events
- **Music as Workshop resources:** Swappable soundtrack packs via D030 — architecture supports this, but audio pipeline needs to be resource-pack-aware
- **Frank Klepacki's music is integral to C&C identity.** The audio system should treat music as a first-class system, not an afterthought. See `13-PHILOSOPHY.md` § "Audio Drives Tempo"
