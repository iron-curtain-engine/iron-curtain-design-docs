**Diagnostic overlay commands (client-local, no network traffic):**

These commands control the real-time diagnostic overlay described in `10-PERFORMANCE.md` § Diagnostic Overlay & Real-Time Observability. They are **client-local** — they read telemetry data already being collected (D031) and do not produce `PlayerOrder`s. Level 1–2 commands are available to all players; Level 3 panels require `dev-tools`.

| `/diag history`         | Toggle graph history mode (scrolling line graphs for key metrics)        | Player     |
| `/diag pos <corner>`    | Move overlay position: `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, `br` (default: `tr`)          | Player     |
| `/diag scale <factor>`  | Scale overlay text size, 0.5–2.0 (accessibility)                        | Player     |
| `/diag export`          | Dump current overlay snapshot to timestamped JSON file                   | Player     |

**Note on DeveloperMode interaction:** Dev commands check `DeveloperMode` sim state (V44). In multiplayer, dev mode must be unanimously enabled in the lobby before game start. Dev commands issued without active dev mode are rejected by the sim with an error message. This is enforced at the order validation layer (D012), not the UI layer.

#### Comprehensive Command Catalog

The design principle: **anything the GUI can do, the console can do.** Every button, menu, slider, and toggle in the game UI has a console command equivalent. This enables scripting via `autoexec.cfg`, accessibility for players who prefer keyboard-driven interfaces, and full remote control for tournament administration. Commands are organized by functional domain — matching the system categories in `02-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Engine-core vs. game-module commands:** Per Invariant #9, the engine core is game-agnostic. Commands are split into two registration layers:

- **Engine commands** (registered by the engine, available to all game modules): `/help`, `/set`, `/get`, `/version`, `/fps`, `/volume`, `/screenshot`, `/camera`, `/zoom`, `/ui_scale`, `/ui_theme`, `/locale`, `/save_game`, `/load_game`, `/clear`, `/players`, etc. These operate on engine-level concepts (rendering, audio, camera, files, cvars) and exist regardless of game module.
- **Game-module commands** (registered by the RA1 module via `GameModule::register_commands()`): `/build`, `/sell`, `/deploy`, `/rally`, `/stance`, `/guard`, `/patrol`, `/power`, `/credits`, `/surrender`, `/power_activate`, etc. These operate on RA1-specific gameplay systems — a Dune II module or tower defense total conversion would register different commands. The tables below include both layers; game-module commands are marked with **(RA1)** where the command is game-module-specific rather than engine-generic.

**Implementation phasing:** This catalog is a **reference target**, not a Phase 3 deliverable. Commands are added incrementally as the systems they control are built — unit commands arrive with Phase 2 (simulation), production/building UI commands with Phase 3 (game chrome), observer commands with Phase 5 (multiplayer), etc. The Brigadier `CommandDispatcher` and cvar system are Phase 3; the full catalog grows across Phases 3–6.

**Camera bookmarks (Generals-style navigation, client-local):** IC formalizes camera bookmarks as a first-class navigation feature on all platforms. Slots `1-9` are **local UI state only** (not synced, not part of replay determinism, no simulation effect). Desktop exposes quick slots through hotkeys (see `17-PLAYER-FLOW.md`), while touch layouts expose a minimap-adjacent bookmark dock (tap = jump, long-press = save). The `/bookmark_set` and `/bookmark` commands remain the canonical full-slot interface and work consistently across desktop, touch, observer, replay, and editor playtest contexts. Local-only D031 telemetry events (`camera_bookmark.set`, `camera_bookmark.jump`) support UX tuning and tutorial hint validation.

| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/save_game [name]`                                 | Save game (default: auto-named with timestamp)                                          |

| `/restart`                                          | Restart current mission/skirmish                                                        |
| `/surrender`                                        | Forfeit current match (alias for `/callvote surrender` in team games, immediate in 1v1) |
| `/gg`                                               | Alias for `/surrender`                                                                  |
| `/ff`                                               | Alias for `/surrender` (LoL/Valorant convention)                                        |
| `/speed <slowest\|slower\|normal\|faster\|fastest>` | Set game speed (single-player or host-only)                                             |

**Game speed and mobile tempo guidance:** `/speed` remains the authoritative gameplay command surface for single-player and host-controlled matches. Any mobile "Tempo Advisor" or comfort warning UI is **advisory only** — it may recommend a range (for touch usability) but never changes or blocks the requested speed by itself. Ranked multiplayer continues to use server-enforced speed (see D055/D064 and `09b-networking.md`).

| `/ui_theme <classic\|remastered\|modern\|name>` | Switch UI theme (D032)                                                   |
| `/encyclopedia [actor_type]`                    | Open encyclopedia (optionally to a specific entry)                       |

**Map interaction commands:**

| Command                   | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/map_ping <x,y> [color]` | Place a map ping visible to allies (with optional color) |
| `/map_draw <on\|off>`     | Toggle minimap drawing mode for tactical markup          |
| `/map_info`               | Display current map name, size, author, and game mode    |

**Localization commands:**

| Command          | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `/locale <code>` | Switch language (e.g., `en`, `de`, `zh-CN`) |
| `/locale_list`   | List available locales                      |

**Note:** Commands that affect simulation state (`/move`, `/attack`, `/build`, `/sell`, `/deploy`, `/stance`, `/surrender`, `/callvote`, `/vote`, `/poll`, etc.) produce `PlayerOrder` variants and flow through the deterministic order pipeline — they are functionally identical to clicking the GUI button. Commands that affect only the local client (`/volume`, `/shadows`, `/zoom`, `/ui_scale`, etc.) take effect immediately without touching the sim. This distinction mirrors the cvar split: sim-affecting cvars require `DEV_ONLY` or `SERVER` flags and use the order pipeline; client-only cvars are immediate. In multiplayer, sim-affecting commands also respect D033 QoL toggle state — if a toggle is disabled in the lobby, the corresponding console command is rejected. See "Competitive Integrity in Multiplayer" below for the full framework.

**PlayerOrder variant taxonomy:** Commands map to `PlayerOrder` variants as follows:
- **GUI-equivalent commands** (`/move`, `/attack`, `/build`, `/sell`, `/deploy`, `/stance`, `/select`, `/place`, etc.) produce the **same native `PlayerOrder` variant** as their GUI counterpart — e.g., `/move 120,80` produces `PlayerOrder::Move { target: WorldPos(120,80) }`, identical to right-clicking the map.
- **Cvar mutations** (`/set <name> <value>`) produce `PlayerOrder::SetCvar(name, value)` when the cvar has `DEV_ONLY` or `SERVER` flags — these flow through order validation.
- **Cheat codes** (hidden phrases typed in chat) produce `PlayerOrder::CheatCode(CheatId)` — see "Hidden Cheat Codes" below.
- **Chat messages** (`/s`, `/w`, unprefixed text) produce `PlayerOrder::ChatMessage { channel, text }` — see D059 § Text Chat.
- **Coordination actions** (pings, chat wheel, minimap drawing) produce their respective `PlayerOrder` variants (`TacticalPing`, `ChatWheelPhrase`, `MinimapDraw`) — see D059 § Coordination.
- **Meta-commands** (`/help`, `/locale`, `/hotkeys`, `/voice diag`, etc.) are **local-only** — they produce no `PlayerOrder` and never touch the sim.
- **`PlayerOrder::ChatCommand(cmd, args)`** is used only for mod-registered commands that produce custom sim-side effects not covered by a native variant. Engine commands never use `ChatCommand`.

**Game-module registration example (RA1):** The RA1 game module registers all RA1-specific commands during `GameModule::register_commands()`. A Tiberian Dawn module would register similar but distinct commands (e.g., `/sell` exists in both, but `/power_activate` with different superweapon names). A total conversion could register entirely novel commands (`/mutate`, `/terraform`, etc.) using the same `CommandDispatcher` infrastructure. This follows the "game is a mod" principle (13-PHILOSOPHY.md § Principle 4) — the base game uses the same registration API available to external modules.

#### Mod-Registered Commands

Mods register commands via the Lua API (D004) or WASM host functions (D005):

```lua
-- Lua mod registration example
Commands.register("spawn_reinforcements", {
    description = "Spawn reinforcements at a location",
    permission = "host",       -- only host can use
    arguments = {
        { name = "faction", type = "string", suggestions = {"allies", "soviet"} },
        { name = "count",   type = "integer", min = 1, max = 50 },
        { name = "location", type = "position" },
    },
    execute = function(source, args)
        -- Mod logic here
        SpawnReinforcements(args.faction, args.count, args.location)
        return "Spawned " .. args.count .. " " .. args.faction .. " reinforcements"
    end
})
```

**Sandboxing:** Mod commands execute within the same Lua sandbox as mission scripts. A mod command cannot access the filesystem, network, or memory outside its sandbox. The `CommandSource` tracks which mod registered the command — if a mod command crashes or times out, the error is attributed to the mod, not the engine.

**Namespace collision:** Mod commands are prefixed with the mod name by default: a mod named `cool_units` registering `spawn` creates `/cool_units:spawn`. Mods can request unprefixed registration (`/spawn`) but collisions are resolved by load order — last mod wins, with a warning logged. The convention follows Minecraft's `namespace:command` pattern.

#### Anti-Trolling Measures

Chat and commands create trolling surfaces. IC addresses each:

| Trolling Vector                                                            | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chat spam**                                                              | Rate limit: max 5 messages per 3 seconds, relay-enforced (see D059 § Text Chat). Client applies the same limit locally to avoid round-trip rejection. Exceeding the limit queues messages with a cooldown warning. Configurable by server.                                                                                                                                |
| **Chat harassment**                                                        | `/ignore` is client-side and instant. `/mute` is admin-enforced and server-side. Ignored players can't whisper you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Unicode abuse** (oversized chars, bidi-spoof controls, invisible chars, zalgo) | Chat input is sanitized **before** order injection: preserve legitimate letters/numbers/punctuation (including Arabic/Hebrew/RTL text), but strip disallowed control/invisible characters used for spoofing, normalize Unicode to NFC, cap display width, and clamp combining-character abuse. Normalization happens on the sending client before the text enters `PlayerOrder::ChatMessage` — ensuring all clients receive identical normalized bytes (determinism requirement). Homoglyph detection warns admins of impersonation attempts. |
| **Command abuse** (admin runs `/kill` on all players)                      | Admin commands that affect other players are logged as telemetry events (D031). Community server governance (D037) allows reputation consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Lua injection** via chat                                                 | Chat messages never touch the command parser unless they start with `/`. A message like `hello /c game.destroy()` is plain text, not a command. Only the first `/` at position 0 triggers command parsing.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Fake command output**                                                    | System messages (command results, join/leave notifications) use a distinct visual style (color, icon) that players cannot replicate through chat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Command spam**                                                           | Commands have the same rate limit as chat. Dev commands additionally logged with timestamps for abuse review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Programmable spam** (Factorio's speaker problem)                         | IC doesn't have programmable speakers, but any future mod-driven notification system should respect the same per-player mute controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Achievement and Ranking Interaction

Following the universal convention (Factorio, AoE, OpenRA):

- **Using any dev command permanently flags the match/save** as using cheats. This is recorded in the replay metadata and sim state.
- **Flagged games cannot count toward ranked matchmaking (D055)** or achievements (D036).
- **The flag is irreversible** for that save/match — even if you toggle dev mode off.
- **Non-dev commands** (`/help`, `/set render.shadows false`, chat, `/ping`) do NOT flag the game. Only commands that affect simulation state through `DevCommand` orders trigger the flag.
- **Saved game cheated flag:** The snapshot (D010) includes `cheats_used: bool` and `cosmetic_cheats_used: bool` fields. Loading a save with `cheats_used = true` displays a permanent "cheats used" indicator and disables achievements. Loading a save with only `cosmetic_cheats_used = true` displays a subtle "cosmetic mods active" indicator but achievements remain enabled. Both flags are irreversible per save and recorded in replay metadata.

This follows Factorio's model — the Lua console is immensely useful for testing and debugging, but using it has clear consequences for competitive integrity — while refining it with a proportional response: gameplay cheats carry full consequences, cosmetic cheats are recorded but don't punish the player for having fun.
