#### Feature Smart Tips (`hints/feature-tips.yaml`)

Non-gameplay feature screens use the same Layer 2 hint pipeline with UI-context triggers. These tips explain what each feature does in simple, approachable language for users encountering it for the first time. All tips are dismissible, respect "don't show again," and share the `hint_history` SQLite table.

#### Trigger Types (Extensible)

| Trigger Type          | Parameters                                         | Fires When                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unit_idle`           | `unit_type`, `idle_duration_seconds`               | A unit of that type has been idle for N seconds                |
| `resource_threshold`  | `resource`, `condition`, `sustained_seconds`       | A resource exceeds/falls below a threshold for N seconds       |
| `unit_count`          | `condition`, `without_action`, `sustained_seconds` | Player has N units and hasn't performed the suggested action   |
| `time_without_action` | `action`, `time_minutes`, `min_game_time_minutes`  | N minutes pass without the player performing a specific action |
| `building_ready`      | `building_type`, `ability`, `first_time`           | A building completes construction (or its ability charges)     |
| `first_encounter`     | `entity_type`                                      | Player sees an enemy unit/building type for the first time     |
| `damage_taken`        | `damage_source_type`, `threshold_percent`          | Player units take significant damage from a specific type      |
| `area_enter`          | `area`, `unit_types`                               | Player units enter a named map region                          |
| `custom`              | `lua_condition`                                    | Lua expression evaluates to true (Tier 2 mods only)            |

**UI-context triggers** — these fire outside gameplay, on feature screens (Workshop, Settings, Player Profile, Main Menu, etc.):

| Trigger Type            | Parameters                                 | Fires When                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui_screen_enter`       | `screen_id`, `first_time`                  | Player navigates to a screen (optionally: first time only)           |
| `ui_element_focus`      | `element_id`, `dwell_seconds`              | Player hovers/dwells on a UI element for N seconds                   |
| `ui_action_attempt`     | `action_id`, `failed`                      | Player attempts a UI action (optionally: only when it fails)         |
| `ui_screen_idle`        | `screen_id`, `idle_seconds`                | Player has been on a screen for N seconds without meaningful input    |
| `ui_feature_unused`     | `feature_id`, `sessions_without_use`       | A feature has been available for N sessions but the player never used it |

UI-context triggers use the same hint pipeline (trigger → filter → render) and the same `hint_history` SQLite table. The only difference is evaluation context: game-state triggers run during simulation ticks, UI-context triggers run on screen navigation and idle timers.

**Position values for UI-context hints:**

In addition to the gameplay positions (`near_unit`, `near_building`, `screen_top`, `near_sidebar`), UI-context hints support:

| Position       | Behavior                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `screen_center`| Centered overlay on the current screen (used for welcome/first-visit tips) |
| `near_element` | Anchored to a specific UI element via `anchor_element` field             |
| `bottom_bar`   | Non-intrusive bar at the bottom of the screen                            |

When `position: near_element` is used, the hint definition must include an `anchor_element` field specifying the logical UI element ID (e.g., `workshop_categories`, `install_button`, `experience_profile_selector`). The renderer resolves logical IDs to screen coordinates using the same `UiAnchorAlias` system as tutorial step highlights.

Modders define new triggers via Lua (Tier 2) or WASM (Tier 3). The `custom` trigger type is a Lua escape hatch for conditions that don't fit the built-in types.

#### Hint History (SQLite)

```sql
-- In player.db (D034)
CREATE TABLE hint_history (
    hint_id       TEXT NOT NULL,
    show_count    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_shown    INTEGER,          -- Unix timestamp
    dismissed     BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,  -- "Don't show again"
    mastery_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      -- times the mastery_action was performed
    PRIMARY KEY (hint_id)
);
```

The hint system queries this table before showing each hint. `mastery_count >= mastery_threshold` suppresses the hint permanently. `dismissed = TRUE` suppresses it permanently. `last_shown + cooldown_seconds > now` suppresses it temporarily.

#### QoL Integration (D033)

Hints are individually toggleable per category in `Settings → QoL → Hints`:

| Setting            | Default (New to RTS) | Default (RA Vet) | Default (OpenRA) |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Economy hints      | On                   | On               | Off              |
| Combat hints       | On                   | Off              | Off              |
| Controls hints     | On                   | On               | Off              |
| Strategy hints     | On                   | Off              | Off              |
| IC new features    | On                   | On               | On               |
| Mod-specific hints | On                   | On               | On               |
| Feature discovery  | On                   | On               | On               |
| Hint frequency     | Normal               | Reduced          | Minimal          |
| EVA voice on hints | On                   | Off              | Off              |

`/hints` console commands (D058): `/hints list`, `/hints enable <category>`, `/hints disable <category>`, `/hints reset`, `/hints suppress <id>`.
