### Layer 2 — Contextual Hints (YAML-Driven, Always-On)

Contextual hints appear as translucent overlay callouts during gameplay, triggered by game state. They are NOT part of Commander School — they work in any game mode (skirmish, multiplayer, custom campaigns). Modders can author custom hints for their mods.

#### Hint Pipeline

```
  HintTrigger          HintFilter           HintRenderer
  (game state     →    (suppression,    →   (overlay, fade,
   evaluation)          cooldowns,           positioning,
                        experience           dismiss)
                        profile)
```

1. **HintTrigger** evaluates conditions against the current game state every N ticks (configurable, default: every 150 ticks / 5 seconds). Triggers are YAML-defined — no Lua required for standard hints.
2. **HintFilter** suppresses hints the player doesn't need: already dismissed, demonstrated mastery (performed the action N times), cooldown not expired, experience profile excludes this hint.
3. **HintRenderer** displays the hint as a UI overlay — positioned near the relevant screen element, with fade-in/fade-out, dismiss button, and "don't show again" toggle.

#### Hint Definition Schema (`hints.yaml`)

```yaml
# hints/base-game.yaml — ships with the game
# Modders create their own hints.yaml in their mod directory
