### Community Transparency Log

The trust model above establishes that the community server only signs credentials it computed or verified. But who watches the server? A malicious or compromised operator could inflate a friend's rating, issue contradictory records to different players (equivocation), or silently revoke and reissue credentials. Players trust the community, but have no way to *audit* it.

IC solves this with a **transparency log** — an append-only Merkle tree of every SCR the community server has ever issued. This is the same technique Google deployed at scale for [Certificate Transparency](https://certificate.transparency.dev/) (CT, RFC 6962) to prevent certificate authorities from issuing rogue TLS certificates. CT has been mandatory for all publicly-trusted certificates since 2018 and processes billions of entries. The insight transfers directly: a community server is a credential authority, and the same accountability mechanism that works for CAs works here.

**How it works:**

1. Every time the community server signs an SCR, it appends `SHA-256(scr_bytes)` as a leaf in an append-only Merkle tree.
2. The server returns an **inclusion proof** alongside the SCR — a set of O(log N) hashes that proves the SCR exists in the tree at a specific index. The player stores this proof alongside the SCR in their local credential file.
3. The server publishes its current **Signed Tree Head** (STH) — the root hash + tree size + a timestamp + the server's signature — at a well-known endpoint (e.g., `GET /transparency/sth`). This is a single ~128-byte value.
4. **Auditors** (any interested party — players, other community operators, automated monitors) periodically fetch the STH and verify **consistency**: that each new STH is an extension of the previous one (no entries removed or rewritten). This is a single O(log N) consistency proof per check.
5. Players can verify their personal inclusion proofs against the published STH — confirming their SCRs are in the same tree everyone else sees.

Inclusion proof for SCR 2: [H(SCR 3), H(0,1)]
→ Verifier recomputes: H(2,3) = H(H(SCR 2) || H(SCR 3)),
   Root = H(H(0,1) || H(2,3)) → must match published STH root.
```

**What this catches:**

| Attack                                                     | How the transparency log detects it                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rating inflation**                                       | Auditor sees a rating SCR that doesn't follow from prior match results in the log. The Merkle tree includes every SCR — match SCRs and rating SCRs are interleaved, so the full causal chain is visible.                   |
| **Equivocation** (different records for different players) | Two players comparing inclusion proofs against the same STH would find one proof fails — the tree can't contain two contradictory entries at the same index. An auditor monitoring the log catches this directly.          |
| **Silent revocation**                                      | Revocation SCRs are logged like any other record. A player whose credential was revoked can see the revocation in the log and verify it was issued by the server, not fabricated.                                          |
| **History rewriting**                                      | Consistency proofs between successive STHs detect any modification to past entries. The append-only structure means the server can't edit history without publishing a new root that's inconsistent with the previous one. |

**What this does NOT provide:**

- **Correctness of game outcomes.** The log proves the server issued a particular SCR. It doesn't prove the underlying match was played fairly — that's the relay's job (`CertifiedMatchResult`). The log is an accountability layer over the signing layer.
- **Real-time fraud prevention.** A compromised server can still issue a bad SCR. The transparency log ensures the bad SCR is *visible* — it can't be quietly slipped in. Detection is retrospective (auditors find it later), not preventive.

**Operational model:**

- **STH publish frequency:** Configurable per community, default hourly. More frequent = faster detection, more bandwidth. Tournament communities might publish every minute during events.
- **Auditor deployment:** The `ic community audit` CLI command fetches and verifies consistency of a community's transparency log. Players can run this manually. Automated monitors (a cron job, a GitHub Action, a community-run service) provide continuous monitoring. IC provides the tooling; communities decide how to deploy it.
- **Log storage:** The Merkle tree is append-only and grows at ~32 bytes per SCR issued (one hash per leaf). A community that issues 100,000 SCRs has a ~3.2 MB log. This is stored server-side in SQLite alongside the existing community state.
- **Inclusion proof size:** O(log N) hashes. For 100,000 SCRs, that's ~17 hashes × 32 bytes = ~544 bytes per proof. Added to the SCR response, this is negligible.

```rust
/// Signed Tree Head — published periodically by the community server.
pub struct SignedTreeHead {
    pub tree_size: u64,            // Number of SCRs in the log
    pub root_hash: [u8; 32],       // SHA-256 Merkle root
    pub timestamp: i64,            // Unix seconds
    pub community_key: [u8; 32],   // Ed25519 public key
    pub signature: [u8; 64],       // Ed25519 signature over the above
}

/// Inclusion proof returned alongside each SCR.
pub struct InclusionProof {
    pub leaf_index: u64,           // Position in the tree
    pub tree_size: u64,            // Tree size at time of inclusion
    pub path: Vec<[u8; 32]>,      // O(log N) sibling hashes
}

/// Consistency proof between two tree heads.
pub struct ConsistencyProof {
    pub old_size: u64,
    pub new_size: u64,
    pub path: Vec<[u8; 32]>,      // O(log N) hashes
}
```

**Phase:** The transparency log ships with the community server in **Phase 5**. It's an integral part of community accountability, not an afterthought. The `ic community audit` CLI command ships in the same phase. Automated monitoring tooling is Phase 6a.

**Why this isn't blockchain:** A transparency log is a cryptographic data structure maintained by a single authority (the community server), auditable by anyone. It provides non-equivocation and append-only guarantees without distributed consensus, proof-of-work, tokens, or peer-to-peer gossip. The server runs it unilaterally; auditors verify it externally. This is orders of magnitude simpler and cheaper than any blockchain — and it's exactly what's needed. Certificate Transparency protects the entire web's TLS infrastructure using this pattern. It works.

### Matchmaking Design

The community server's matchmaking uses verified ratings from presented SCRs:

```rust
/// Matchmaking pool entry — one per connected player seeking a game.
pub struct MatchmakingEntry {
    pub player_key: Ed25519PublicKey,
    pub verified_rating: PlayerRating,    // From verified SCR
    pub game_module: GameModuleId,        // What game they want to play
    pub preferences: MatchPreferences,    // Map pool, team size, etc.
    pub queue_time: Instant,              // When they started searching
}

/// Server-side matchmaking loop (simplified).
fn matchmaking_tick(pool: &mut Vec<MatchmakingEntry>, provider: &dyn RankingProvider) {
    // Sort by queue time (longest-waiting first)
    pool.sort_by_key(|e| e.queue_time);
    
    for candidate_pair in pool.windows(2) {
        let quality = provider.match_quality(
            &[candidate_pair[0].verified_rating],
            &[candidate_pair[1].verified_rating],
        );
        
        if quality.fairness > FAIRNESS_THRESHOLD || queue_time_exceeded(candidate_pair) {
            // Accept match — create lobby
            create_lobby(candidate_pair);
        }
    }
}
```

**Matchmaking widens over time:** Initial search window is tight (±100 rating). After 30 seconds, widens to ±200. After 60 seconds, ±400. After 120 seconds, accepts any match. This prevents indefinite queues for players at rating extremes.

**Team games:** For 2v2+ matchmaking, the server balances team average ratings. Each player's SCR is individually verified. Team rating = average of individual Glicko-2 ratings.

### Lobby & Room Discovery

Matchmaking (above) handles competitive/ranked play. But most RTS games are casual — "join my friend's game," "let's play a LAN match," "come watch my stream and play." These need a room-based lobby with low-friction discovery. IC provides five discovery tiers, from zero-infrastructure to full game browser. Every tier works on every platform (desktop, browser, mobile — Invariant #10).

**Tier 0 — Direct Connect (IP:port)**

Always available, zero external dependency. Type an IP address and port, connect. Works on LAN, works over internet with port forwarding. This is the escape hatch — if every server is down, two players with IP addresses can still play.

```
ic play connect 192.168.1.42:7400
```

If a deferred direct-peer gameplay mode is ever enabled (for example, explicit LAN/experimental variants without relay authority), the host is the connection target. For relay-hosted games (the default), this is the relay address. No discovery mechanism is needed when endpoints are already known.

**Tier 1 — Room Codes (Among Us pattern, decentralized)**

When a host creates a room on any relay or community server, the server assigns a short alphanumeric code. Share it verbally, paste it in Discord, text it to a friend.

```
Room code: TKR-4N7
```

**Code format:**
- 6 characters from an unambiguous set: `23456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ` (30 chars, excludes 0/O, 1/I/L)
- Displayed as `XXX-XXX` for readability
- 30^6 ≈ 729 million combinations — more than enough
- Case-insensitive input (the UI uppercases automatically)
- Codes are ephemeral — exist only in server memory, expire when the room closes + 5-minute grace

**Resolution:** Player enters the code in-game. The client queries all configured community servers in parallel (typically 1–3 HTTP requests). Whichever server recognizes the code responds with connection info (relay address + room ID + required resources). No central "code directory" — every community server manages its own code namespace. Collision across communities is fine because clients verify the code against the responding server.

```
ic play join TKR-4N7
```

**Why Among Us-style codes?** Among Us popularized this pattern because it works for exactly the scenario IC targets: you're in a voice call, someone says "join TKR-4N7," everyone types it in 3 seconds. No URLs, no IP addresses, no friend lists. The friction is nearly zero. For an RTS with 2–8 players, this is the sweet spot.

**Tier 2 — QR Code**

The host's client generates a QR code that encodes a deep link URI:

```
ironcurtain://join/community.example.com/TKR-4N7
```

Scanning the QR code opens the IC client (or the browser version on mobile) and auto-joins the room. Perfect for:

- **LAN parties:** Display QR on the host's screen. Everyone scans with their phone/tablet to join via browser client.
- **Couch co-op:** Scan from a phone to open the WASM browser client on a second device.
- **Streaming:** Overlay QR on stream → viewers scan to join or spectate.
- **In-person events / tournaments:** Print QR on table tents.

The QR code is regenerated if the room code changes (e.g., room migrates to a different relay). The deep link URI scheme (`ironcurtain://`) is registered on desktop; on platforms without scheme registration, the QR can encode an HTTPS URL (`https://play.ironcurtain.gg/join/TKR-4N7`) that redirects to the client or browser version.

**Tier 3 — Game Browser**

Community servers publish their active rooms to a room listing API. The in-game browser aggregates listings from all configured communities — the same federation model as Workshop source aggregation.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Game Browser                                    [Refresh]  │
├──────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────┬──────┬─────────────┤
│ Room Name    │ Host │ Players │ Map    │ Ping │ Mods        │
├──────────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────┼──────┼─────────────┤
│ Casual 1v1   │ cmdr │ 1/2     │ Arena  │ 23ms │ none        │

│ Newbies Only │ bob  │ 2/6     │ Desert │ 67ms │ none        │
└──────────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────┴──────┴─────────────┘
```

This is the traditional server browser experience (OpenRA has this, Quake had this, every classic RTS had this). It coexists with room codes — a room visible in the browser also has a room code.

**Room listing API payload** — community servers publish room metadata via a structured API. The full field set, filtering/sorting capabilities, and client-side browser organization (favorites, history, blacklist, friends' games, LAN tab, quick join) are documented in `player-flow/multiplayer.md` § Game Browser. The listing payload includes:

- **Identity:** room name, host name (verified badge), dedicated/listen flag, optional description, optional MOTD, server URL/rules page, free-form tags/keywords
- **Game state:** status (waiting/in-game/post-game), granular lobby phase, playtime/duration, rejoinable flag, replay recording flag
- **Players:** current/max players, team format (1v1/2v2/FFA/co-op), AI count + difficulty, spectator count/slots, open slots, average player rating, player competitive ranks
- **Map:** name, preview thumbnail, size, tileset/theater, type (skirmish/scenario/random), source (built-in/workshop/custom), designed player capacity
- **Game rules:** game module (RA/TD), game type (casual/competitive/co-op/tournament), experience preset (D033), victory conditions, game speed, starting credits, fog of war mode, crates, superweapons, tech level, host-curated viewable cvars (D064)
- **Mods & version:** engine version, mod name + version, content fingerprint/hash (map + mods — prevents join-then-desync in lockstep), client-side mod compatibility indicator (green/yellow/red), pure/unmodded flag, protocol version range
- **Network:** ping/latency, relay server region, relay operator, connection type (relayed/direct/LAN)
- **Trust & access:** trust label (D011: IC Certified/Casual/Cross-Engine/Foreign), public/private/invite-only, community membership with verified badges/icons/logos, community tags, minimum rank requirement
- **Communication:** voice chat enabled/disabled (D059), language preference, AllChat policy
- **Tournament:** tournament ID/name, bracket link, shoutcast/stream URL

**Anti-abuse for listings:**
- Room names, descriptions, and tags are subject to relay-side content filtering (configurable per community server, D064)
- Custom icons/logos require community-level verification to prevent impersonation
- Listing TTL with heartbeat — stale listings expire automatically (OpenRA pattern)
- Community servers can delist rooms that violate their policies
- Client-side blacklist allows players to permanently hide specific servers

**Tier 4 — Matchmaking Queue (D052)**

Already designed above. Player enters a queue; community server matches by rating. This creates rooms automatically — the player never sees a room code or browser.

**Tier 5 — Deep Links / Invites**

The `ironcurtain://join/...` URI scheme works as a clickable link anywhere that supports URI schemes:

- Discord: paste `ironcurtain://join/official.ironcurtain.gg/TKR-4N7` → click to join
- Browser: HTTPS fallback URL redirects to client or opens browser WASM version
- Steam: Steam rich presence integration → "Join Game" button on friend's profile
- In-game friends list (if implemented): one-click invite sends a deep link

**Discovery summary:**

| Tier | Mechanism      | Requires Server?          | Best For                       | Friction             |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 0    | Direct IP:port | No                        | LAN, development, fallback     | High (must know IP)  |
| 1    | Room codes     | Yes (any relay/community) | Friends, voice chat, casual    | Very low (6 chars)   |
| 2    | QR code        | Yes (same as room code)   | LAN parties, streaming, mobile | Near zero (scan)     |
| 3    | Game browser   | Yes (community servers)   | Finding public games           | Low (browse + click) |
| 4    | Matchmaking    | Yes (community server)    | Competitive/ranked             | Zero (press "Play")  |
| 5    | Deep links     | Yes (same as room code)   | Discord, web, social           | Near zero (click)    |

Tiers 0–2 work with a single self-hosted relay (a $5 VPS or even localhost). No official infrastructure required. Tiers 3–4 require community servers. Tier 5 requires URI scheme registration (desktop) or an HTTPS redirect service (browser).

### Lobby Communication

Once players are in a room, they need to communicate — coordinate strategy before the game, socialize, discuss map picks, or just talk. IC provides text chat, voice chat, and visible player identity in every lobby.

**Text Chat**

All lobby text messages are routed through the relay server (or host in P2P mode) — the same path as game orders. This keeps the trust model consistent: the relay timestamps and sequences messages, making chat moderation actions deterministic and auditable.

```rust
/// Lobby chat message — part of the room protocol, not the sim protocol.
/// Routed through the relay alongside PlayerOrders but on a separate
/// logical channel (not processed by ic-sim).
pub struct LobbyMessage {
    pub sender: PlayerId,
    pub channel: ChatChannel,
    pub content: String,         // UTF-8, max 500 bytes
    pub timestamp: u64,          // relay-assigned, not client-claimed
}

pub enum ChatChannel {
    All,                         // Everyone in the room sees it
    Team(TeamId),                // Team-only (pre-game team selection)
    Whisper(PlayerId),           // Private message to one player
    System,                      // Join/leave/kick notifications (server-generated)
}
```

**Chat features:**

- **Rate limiting:** Max 5 messages per 3 seconds per player. Prevents spam flooding.
- **Message length:** Max 500 bytes UTF-8. Long enough for tactical callouts, short enough to prevent wall-of-text abuse.
- **Host moderation:** Room host can mute individual players (host sends a `MutePlayer` command; relay enforces). Muted players' messages are silently dropped by the relay — other clients never receive them.
- **Persistent for room lifetime:** Chat history is available to newly joining players (last 50 messages). When the room closes, chat is discarded — no server-side chat logging.
- **In-game chat:** During gameplay, the same chat system operates. `All` channel becomes `Spectator` for observers. `Team` channel carries strategic communication. A configurable `AllChat` toggle (default: disabled in ranked) controls whether opponents can see your messages during a match.
- **Links and formatting:** URLs are clickable (opens external browser). No rich text — plain text only. This prevents injection attacks and keeps the UI simple.
- **Emoji:** Standard Unicode emoji are rendered natively. No custom emoji system — keep it simple.
- **Block list:** Players can block others locally. Blocked players' messages are filtered client-side (not server-enforced — the relay doesn't need to know your block list). Block persists across sessions in local SQLite (D034).

**In-game chat UI:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The chat panel is collapsible (hotkey: Enter to open, Escape to close — standard RTS convention). During gameplay, it overlays transparently so it doesn't obscure the battlefield.

**Voice Chat**

IC includes built-in voice communication using relay-forwarded Opus audio. Voice data never touches the sim — it's a purely transport-layer feature with zero determinism impact.

**Architecture:**

```
┌────────┐              ┌─────────────┐              ┌────────┐
│Player A│─── Opus ────►│ Room Server │─── Opus ────►│Player B│
│        │◄── Opus ─────│  (D052)     │◄── Opus ─────│        │
└────────┘              │             │              └────────┘
                        │  Stateless  │
┌────────┐              │  forwarding │
│Player C│─── Opus ────►│             │
│        │◄── Opus ─────│             │
└────────┘              └─────────────┘
```

- **Relay-forwarded audio:** Voice data flows through the room server (D052), maintaining IP privacy — the same principle as D059's in-game voice design. The room server performs stateless Opus packet forwarding (copies bytes without decoding). This prevents IP exposure, which is a known harassment vector even in the pre-game lobby phase.
- **Lobby → game transition:** When the match starts and clients connect to the game relay, voice seamlessly transitions from the room server to the game relay. No reconnection is needed — the relay assumes voice forwarding from the room server's role. If the room server and game relay are the same process (common for community servers), the transition is a no-op.
- **Push-to-talk (default):** RTS players need both hands on mouse/keyboard during games. Push-to-talk avoids accidental transmission of keyboard clatter, breathing, and background noise. Default keybind: `V`. Voice activation mode available in settings for players who prefer it.
- **Per-player volume:** Each player's voice volume is adjustable independently (right-click their name in the player list → volume slider). Mute individual players with one click.
- **Voice channels:** Mirror text chat channels — All, Team. During gameplay, voice defaults to Team-only to prevent leaking strategy to opponents. Spectators have their own voice channel.
- **Codec:** Opus (standard WebRTC codec). 32 kbps mono is sufficient for clear voice in a game context. Total bandwidth for a full 8-player lobby: ~224 kbps (7 incoming streams × 32 kbps) — negligible compared to game traffic.
- **Browser (WASM) support:** Browser builds use WebRTC via `str0m` for voice (see D059 § VoiceTransport). Desktop builds send Opus packets directly on the `Transport` connection's `MessageLane::Voice`.

**Voice UI indicators:**

```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Players:               │
│  🔊 cmdr (host)   1800 │  ← speaking indicator
│  🔇 alice         1650 │  ← muted by self
│  🎤 bob           1520 │  ← has mic, not speaking
│  📵 carol         ---- │  ← voice disabled
└────────────────────────┘
```

Speaking indicators appear next to player names in the lobby and during gameplay (small icon on the player's color bar in the sidebar). This lets players see who's talking at a glance.

**Privacy and safety:**

- Voice is opt-in. Players can disable voice entirely in settings. The client never activates the microphone without explicit user action (push-to-talk press or voice activation toggle).
- No voice recording by the relay or community server during normal operation. Voice streams are ephemeral in the relay pipeline. (Note: D059 adds opt-in voice-in-replay where consenting players' voice is captured client-side during gameplay — this is client-local recording with consent, not relay-side recording.)
- Abusive voice users can be muted by any player (locally) or by the host (server-enforced kick from voice channel).
- Ranked/competitive rooms can enforce "no voice" or "team-voice-only" policies.

**When external voice is better:** IC's built-in voice is designed for casual lobbies, LAN parties, and pickup games where players don't have a pre-existing Discord/TeamSpeak. Competitive teams will continue using external voice (lower latency, better quality, persistent channels). IC doesn't try to replace Discord — it provides a frictionless default for when Discord isn't set up.

**Player Identity in Lobby**

Every player in a lobby is visible with their profile identity — not just a text name. The lobby player list shows:

- **Avatar:** Small profile image (32×32 in list, 64×64 on hover/click). Sourced from the player's profile (see D053).
- **Display name:** The player's chosen name. If the player has a community-verified identity (D052 SCR), a small badge appears next to the name indicating which community verified them.
- **Rating badge:** If the room is on a community server, the player's verified rating for the relevant game module is shown (from their presented SCR). Unranked players show "—".
- **Presence indicators:** Microphone status, ready state, download progress (if syncing resources).

Clicking a player's name in the lobby opens a **profile card** — a compact view of their player profile (D053) showing avatar, bio, recent achievements, win rate, and community memberships. This lets players gauge each other before a match without leaving the lobby.

The profile card also exposes scoped quick actions:
- **Mute** (D059, local communication control)
- **Block** (local social preference)
- **Report** (community moderation signal with evidence handoff to D052 review pipeline)
- **Avoid Player** (D055 matchmaking preference, best-effort only — clearly labeled as non-guaranteed in ranked)

The left panel shows players with avatars (small square icons), voice status, community rating badges, and ready state. The right panel is the chat. The layout adapts to screen size (D032 responsive UI) — on narrow screens, chat slides below the player list.

**Phase:** Text chat ships with lobby implementation (Phase 5). Voice chat Phase 5–6a. Profile images in lobby require D053 (Player Profile, Phase 3–5).

### In-Lobby P2P Resource Sharing

When a player joins a room that requires resources (mods, maps, resource packs) they don't have locally, the lobby becomes a P2P swarm for those resources. The relay server (or host in P2P mode) acts as the tracker. This is the existing D049 P2P protocol scoped to a single lobby's resource list.

**Flow:**

```
Host creates room
  → declares required: [alice/hd-sprites@2.0, bob/desert-map@1.1]
  → host seeds both resources

Player joins room
  → receives resource list with SHA-256 from Workshop index
  → checks local cache: has alice/hd-sprites@2.0 ✓, missing bob/desert-map@1.1 ✗

  → Step 1: Verify resource exists in a known Workshop source
    Client fetches manifest for bob/desert-map@1.1 from Workshop index
    (git-index HTTP fetch or Workshop server API)
    Gets: SHA-256, manifest_hash, size, dependencies
    If resource NOT in any configured Workshop source → REFUSE download
    (prevents arbitrary file transfer — Workshop index is the trust anchor)

  → Step 2: Join lobby resource swarm
    Relay/host announces available peers for bob/desert-map@1.1
    Download via BitTorrent protocol from:
      Priority 1: Other lobby players who already have it (lowest latency)
      Priority 2: Workshop P2P swarm (general seeders)
      Priority 3: Workshop HTTP fallback (CDN/GitHub Releases)

  → Step 3: Verify
    SHA-256 of downloaded .icpkg matches Workshop index manifest ✓
    manifest_hash of internal manifest.yaml matches index ✓
    (Same verification chain as regular Workshop install — see V20)

  → Step 4: Report ready
    Client signals lobby: "all resources verified, ready to play"

All players ready → countdown → game starts
```

**The host-as-tracker model:**

For relay-hosted games (the default), the relay IS the tracker — it already manages all connections in the room. It maintains an in-memory peer table: which players have which resources. When a new player joins and needs resources, the relay tells them which peers can seed. This is trivial — a `HashMap<ResourceId, Vec<PeerId>>` that lives only as long as the room exists.

For deferred direct-peer games (if enabled for explicit LAN/experimental use without relay authority): the host's game client runs a minimal tracker. Same data structure, same protocol, just embedded in the game client instead of a separate relay process. The host is already acting as connection coordinator, so adding resource tracking is marginal.

**Security model — preventing malicious content transfer:**

The critical constraint: **only Workshop-published resources can be shared in a lobby.** The lobby declares resources by their Workshop identity (`publisher/package@version`), not by arbitrary file paths. The security chain:

1. **Workshop index is the trust anchor.** Every resource has a SHA-256 and `manifest_hash` recorded in a Workshop index (git-index with signed commits or Workshop server API). The client must be able to look up the resource in a known Workshop source before downloading.
2. **Content verification is mandatory.** After download, the client verifies SHA-256 (full package) and `manifest_hash` (internal manifest) against the Workshop index — not against the host's claim. Even if every other player in the lobby is malicious, a single honest Workshop index protects the downloading player.
3. **Unknown resources are refused.** If a room requires `evil/malware@1.0` and that doesn't exist in any Workshop source the player has configured, the client refuses to download and warns: "Resource not found in any configured Workshop source. Add the community's Workshop source or leave the lobby."
4. **No arbitrary file transfer.** The P2P protocol only transfers `.icpkg` archives that match Workshop-published checksums. There is no mechanism for peers to push arbitrary files — the protocol is pull-only and content-addressed.
5. **Mod sandbox limits blast radius.** Even a resource that passes all integrity checks is still subject to WASM capability sandbox (D005), Lua execution limits (D004), and YAML schema validation (D003). A malicious mod that sneaks past Workshop review can at most affect gameplay within its declared capabilities.
6. **Post-install scanning (Phase 6a+).** When a resource is auto-downloaded in a lobby, the client checks for Workshop security advisories (V18) before loading it. If the resource version has a known advisory → warn the player before proceeding.

**What about custom maps not on the Workshop?**

For early phases (before Workshop exists) or for truly private content: the host can share a map file by embedding it in the room's initial payload (small maps are <1MB). The receiving client:
- Must explicitly accept ("Host wants to share a custom map not published on Workshop. Accept? [Yes/No]")
- The file is verified for format validity (must parse as a valid IC map) but has no Workshop-grade integrity chain
- These maps are quarantined (loaded but not added to the player's Workshop cache)
- This is the "developer/testing" escape hatch — not the normal flow

This escape hatch is disabled by default in competitive/ranked rooms (community servers can enforce "Workshop-only" policies).

**Bandwidth and timing:**

The lobby applies D049's `lobby-urgent` priority tier — auto-downloads preempt background Workshop activity and get full available bandwidth. Combined with the lobby swarm (host + ready players all seeding), typical resource downloads complete in seconds for common mods (<50MB). The download timer can be configured per-community: tournament servers might set a 60-second download window, casual rooms wait indefinitely.

If a player's download is too slow (configurable threshold, e.g., 5 minutes), the lobby UI offers: "Download taking too long. [Keep waiting] [Download in background and spectate] [Leave lobby]".

**Local resource lifecycle:** Resources downloaded via lobby P2P are tagged as **transient** (not pinned). They remain fully functional but auto-clean after `transient_ttl_days` (default 30 days) of non-use. After the session, a post-match toast offers: "[Pin] [Auto-clean in 30 days] [Remove now]". Frequently-used lobby resources (3+ sessions) are automatically promoted to pinned. See D030 § "Local Resource Management" for the full lifecycle.

Default: **Glicko-2** (already specified in D041 as `Glicko2Provider`).

Why Glicko-2 over alternatives:
- **Rating deviation** naturally models uncertainty. New players have wide confidence intervals (RD ~350); experienced players have narrow ones (RD ~50). Matchmaking can use RD to avoid matching a highly uncertain new player against a stable veteran.
- **Inactivity decay:** RD increases over time without play. A player who hasn't played in months is correctly modeled as "uncertain" — their first few games back will move their rating significantly, then stabilize.
- **Open and unpatented.** TrueSkill (Microsoft) and TrueSkill 2 are patented. Glicko-2 is published freely by Mark Glickman.
- **Lichess uses it.** Proven at scale in a competitive community with similar dynamics (skill-based 1v1 with occasional team play).
- **RankingProvider trait (D041)** makes this swappable. Communities that want Elo, or a league/tier system, or a custom algorithm, implement the trait.
