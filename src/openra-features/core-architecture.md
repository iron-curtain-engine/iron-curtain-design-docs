## 1. Trait System (Actor Component Architecture)

OpenRA's core architecture uses a **trait system** — essentially a component-entity model. Every actor (unit, building, prop) is defined by composing traits in YAML. Each trait is a C# class implementing one or more interfaces. Traits attach to actors, players, or the world.

### Core Trait Infrastructure
- **TraitsInterfaces** — Master file defining all trait interfaces (`ITraitInfo`, `IOccupySpace`, `IPositionable`, `IMove`, `IFacing`, `IHealth`, `INotifyCreated`, `INotifyDamage`, `INotifyKilled`, `IWorldLoaded`, `ITick`, `IRender`, `IResolveOrder`, `IOrderVoice`, etc.)
- **ConditionalTrait** — Base class enabling traits to be enabled/disabled by conditions
- **PausableConditionalTrait** — Conditional trait that can also be paused
- **Target** — Represents a target for orders/attacks (actor, terrain position, frozen actor)
- **ActivityUtils** — Utilities for the activity (action queue) system
- **LintAttributes** — Compile-time validation attributes for trait definitions

**Production model diversity across mods:** Analysis of six major OpenRA community mods (see `research/openra-mod-architecture-analysis.md`) reveals that production is one of the most varied mechanics across RTS games — even the 13 traits above only cover the C&C family. Community mods demonstrate at least five fundamentally different production models:

| Model                 | Mod                     | IC Implication                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global sidebar queue  | RA1, TD (OpenRA core)   | `ClassicProductionQueue` — IC's RA1 default                                                    |
| Tabbed parallel queue | RA2, Romanovs-Vengeance | `ClassicParallelProductionQueue` — one queue per factory                                       |
| Per-building on-site  | OpenKrush (KKnD)        | Replaced `ProductionQueue` entirely with custom `SelfConstructing` + per-building rally points |
| Single-unit selection | d2 (Dune II)            | No queue at all — select building, click one unit, wait                                        |
| Colony-based          | OpenSA (Swarm Assault)  | Capture colony buildings for production; no construction yard, no sidebar                      |

IC must treat production as a game-module concern, not an engine assumption. The `ProductionQueue` component is defined by the game module, not the engine core (see `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Production Model Diversity").

## 4. Condition System (~34 traits)

The condition system is OpenRA's primary mechanism for dynamic behavior modification. Conditions are boolean flags that enable/disable conditional traits.
