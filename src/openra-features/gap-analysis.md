# Iron Curtain Gap Analysis

> **Purpose:** Cross-reference every OpenRA feature against Iron Curtain's design docs.
> Identify what's covered, what's partially covered, and what's completely missing.
> The goal: an OpenRA modder should feel **at home** — every concept they know has an equivalent.

## Coverage Legend

| Symbol | Meaning                                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅      | **Fully covered** — designed at equivalent or better detail than OpenRA               |
| ⚠️      | **Partially covered** — mentioned or implied, but not designed as a standalone system |
| ❌      | **Missing** — not addressed in any design doc; needs design work                      |
| 🔄      | **Different by design** — our architecture handles this differently (explained)       |

## 1. Trait System → ECS Components ✅ (structurally different, equivalent power)

**OpenRA:** ~130 C# trait classes attached to actors via MiniYAML. Modders compose actor behavior by listing traits.

**Iron Curtain:** Bevy ECS components attached to entities. Modders compose entity behavior by listing components in YAML. The `GameModule` trait registers components dynamically.

**Modder experience:** Nearly identical. Instead of:
```yaml
# OpenRA MiniYAML
rifle_infantry:
    Health:
        HP: 50
    Mobile:
        Speed: 56
    Armament:
        Weapon: M1Carbine
```
They write:
```yaml
# Iron Curtain YAML
rifle_infantry:
    health:
        current: 50
        max: 50
    mobile:
        speed: 56
        locomotor: foot
    combat:
        weapon: m1_carbine
```

**Gap:** Our design docs only map ~9 components (Health, Mobile, Attackable, Armament, Building, Buildable, Selectable, Harvester, LlmMeta). OpenRA has ~130 traits. Many are render traits (covered by Bevy), but the following gameplay traits need explicit ECS component designs — see the per-system analysis below.

---

## 2. Condition System ✅ DESIGNED (D028 — Phase 2 Hard Requirement)

**OpenRA:** 34 `GrantCondition*` traits. This is **the #1 modding tool**. Modders create dynamic behavior by granting/revoking named boolean conditions that enable/disable `ConditionalTrait`-based components.

Example: a unit becomes stealthed when stationary, gains a damage bonus when veterancy reaches level 2, deploys into a stationary turret — all done purely in YAML by composing condition traits.

```yaml
# OpenRA — no code needed for complex behaviors
Cloak:
    RequiresCondition: !moving
GrantConditionOnMovement:
    Condition: moving
GrantConditionOnDamageState:
    Condition: damaged
    ValidDamageStates: Critical
DamageMultiplier@CRITICAL:
    RequiresCondition: damaged
    Modifier: 150
```

**Iron Curtain status:** **Designed and scheduled as Phase 2 exit criterion (D028).** The condition system is a core modding primitive:
- `Conditions` component: `BTreeMap<ConditionId, u32>` (ref-counted named conditions per entity; `BTreeMap` per deterministic collection policy)
- Condition sources: `GrantConditionOnMovement`, `GrantConditionOnDamageState`, `GrantConditionOnDeploy`, `GrantConditionOnAttack`, `GrantConditionOnTerrain`, `GrantConditionOnVeterancy` — all exposed in YAML
- Condition consumers: any component field can declare `requires:` or `disabled_by:` conditions
- Runtime: systems check `conditions.is_active("deployed")` via fast bitset or hash lookup
- OpenRA trait names accepted as aliases (D023) — `GrantConditionOnMovement` works in IC YAML

**Design sketch:**
```yaml
# Iron Curtain equivalent
rifle_infantry:
    conditions:
        moving:
            granted_by: [on_movement]
        deployed:
            granted_by: [on_deploy]
        elite:
            granted_by: [on_veterancy, { level: 3 }]
    cloak:
        disabled_by: moving      # conditional — disabled when "moving" condition is active
    damage_multiplier:
        requires: deployed
        modifier: 1.5
```

ECS implementation: a `Conditions` component holding a `BTreeMap<ConditionId, u32>` (ref-counted; `BTreeMap` per deterministic collection policy — see D028). Systems check `conditions.is_active("deployed")`. YAML `disabled_by` / `requires` fields map to runtime condition checks.

---

## 3. Multiplier System ✅ DESIGNED (D028 — Phase 2 Hard Requirement)

**OpenRA:** ~20 multiplier traits that modify numeric values. All conditional. Modders stack multipliers from veterancy, terrain, crates, conditions, player handicaps.

| Multiplier                 | Affects         |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| `DamageMultiplier`         | Incoming damage |
| `FirepowerMultiplier`      | Outgoing damage |
| `SpeedMultiplier`          | Movement speed  |
| `RangeMultiplier`          | Weapon range    |
| `ReloadDelayMultiplier`    | Weapon reload   |
| `ProductionCostMultiplier` | Build cost      |
| `ProductionTimeMultiplier` | Build time      |
| `RevealsShroudMultiplier`  | Sight range     |
| ...                        | (20 total)      |

**Iron Curtain status:** **Designed and scheduled as Phase 2 exit criterion (D028).** The multiplier system:
- `StatModifiers` component: per-entity stack of `(source, stat, modifier_value, condition)` tuples
- Every numeric stat (speed, damage, range, reload, build time, cost, sight range) resolves through the modifier stack
- Modifiers from: veterancy, terrain, crates, conditions, player handicaps
- Fixed-point multiplication (no floats) — respects invariant #1
- YAML-configurable: modders add multipliers without code
- Integrates with condition system: multipliers can be conditional (`requires: elite`)

---

## 4. Projectile System ⚠️ PARTIAL

**OpenRA:** 8 projectile types (Bullet, Missile, LaserZap, Railgun, AreaBeam, InstantHit, GravityBomb, NukeLaunch) — each with distinct physics, rendering, and behavior.

**Iron Curtain status:** Weapons are mentioned (weapon definitions in YAML with range, damage, fire rate, AoE). But the **projectile** as a simulation entity with travel time, tracking, gravity, jinking, etc. is not designed.

**Gap:** Need to design:
- Projectile entity lifecycle (spawn → travel → impact → warhead application)
- Projectile types and their physics (ballistic arc, guided tracking, instant hit, beam)
- Projectile rendering (sprite, beam, trail, contrail)
- Missile guidance (homing, jinking, terrain following)

---

## 5. Warhead System ✅ DESIGNED (D028 — Phase 2 Hard Requirement)

**OpenRA:** 15 warhead types. Multiple warheads per weapon. Warheads define *what happens on impact* — damage, terrain modification, condition application, screen effects, resource creation/destruction.

**Iron Curtain status:** **Designed as part of the full damage pipeline in D028 (Phase 2 exit criterion).** The warhead system:
- Each weapon references one or more warheads — composable effects
- Warheads define: damage (with Versus table lookup), condition application, terrain effects, screen effects, resource modification
- Full pipeline: Armament → Projectile entity → travel → impact → Warhead(s) → Versus table → DamageMultiplier → Health
- Extensible via WASM for novel warhead types (WarpDamage, TintedCells, etc.)

Warheads are how modders create multi-effect weapons, percentage-based damage, condition-applying attacks, and terrain-modifying impacts.

| Sell mechanic                        | ✅ `Sellable { refund_percent, sell_time }` component              |
| Building repair                      | ✅ `Repairable { repair_rate, repair_cost_per_hp }` component      |
| Landing pad reservation              | ✅ Covered by docking system (`DockHost` with `DockType::Helipad`) |
| Gate (openable barriers)             | ✅ `Gate { open_delay, close_delay, state }` component             |
| Building transforms                  | ✅ `Transforms { into, delay }` component (MCV ↔ ConYard)          |

- Plug entry grants condition per plug (e.g., "+50 power per infantry in reactor")
- Primarily RA2 mechanic, included for mod compatibility

---

## 25. Transform Mechanics ✅ DESIGNED

OpenRA Lua missions run unmodified.

IC extends with additional globals: `Campaign` (D021 branching campaigns), `Weather` (D022 dynamic weather), `Workshop` (mod queries), `LLM` (Phase 7 integration).

Each actor reference exposes properties matching its components (`.Health`, `.Location`, `.Owner`, `.Move()`, `.Attack()`, `.Stop()`, `.Guard()`, `.Deploy()`, etc.) — identical to OpenRA's actor property groups.

---

## 30. Map Editor ✅ RESOLVED (D038 + D040)

**OpenRA:** Full in-engine map editor with actor placement, terrain painting, resource placement, tile editing, undo/redo, script cell triggers, marker layers, road/path tiling tool.

**Iron Curtain status:** Resolved as D038+D040 — SDK scenario editor & asset studio (OFP/Eden-inspired). Ships as part of the IC SDK (separate application from the game). Goes beyond OpenRA's map editor to include full mission logic editing: triggers with countdown/timeout timers and min/mid/max randomization, waypoints, pre-built modules (wave spawner, patrol route, guard position, reinforcements, objectives), visual connection lines, Probability of Presence per entity for replayability, compositions (reusable prefabs), layers, Simple/Advanced mode toggle, Test button, Game Master mode, Workshop publishing.

- Priority-based selection: when box covers mixed types, prefer higher-priority (Combat > Harvester)
- Double-click: select all visible units of same type owned by same player
- Ctrl+click: add/remove from selection
- Tab cycling: rotate through unit types within selection
- Control groups: Ctrl+1..9 to assign, 1..9 to recall, double-tap to center camera
- Selection limit: configurable (default 40) — excess units excluded by distance from box center
- Isometric diamond selection boxes for proper 2.5D feel

## 34. Game Speed System ✅ DESIGNED

**OpenRA:** 6 game speed presets (Slowest 80ms → Fastest 20ms). Configurable in lobby.

**Iron Curtain status:** Fully designed in `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Extended Gameplay Systems — Game Speed":
- `SpeedPreset` enum: `Slowest` (80ms), `Slower` (67ms, default), `Normal` (50ms), `Faster` (35ms), `Fastest` (20ms)
- Lobby-configurable; speed affects tick interval only (systems run identically at any speed)
- Single-player: speed adjustable at runtime via hotkey (+ / −)
- Pause support in single-player

## 35. Faction System ✅ DESIGNED

**OpenRA:** `Faction` trait (name, internal name, side). Factions determine tech trees, unit availability, starting configurations.

**Iron Curtain status:** Fully designed in `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Extended Gameplay Systems — Faction System":
- `Faction { id, display_name, side, color_default, tech_tree }` YAML-defined
- `Side` grouping (e.g., `allies` contains England/France/Germany subfactions in RA)
- Faction → available `Buildable` items via `tech_tree` (list of unlockable actor IDs)
- Faction → starting units configuration (map-defined or mod-default)
- Lobby faction selection with random option
- RA2+ subfaction support: each subfaction gets unique units/abilities while sharing the side's base roster

## 36. Replay Browser ⚠️ PARTIAL

**OpenRA:** Full replay browser with filtering (by map, players, date), sorting, metadata display, replay playback with speed control.

**Iron Curtain status:** `ReplayPlayback` NetworkModel designed. Signed replays with hash chains. But the **replay browser UI** and metadata storage aren't designed.

---

## 37. Encyclopedia / Asset Browser ✅ DESIGNED

**OpenRA:** In-game encyclopedia with unit descriptions, stats, and previews. Asset browser for modders to preview sprites, sounds, videos.

**Iron Curtain status:** Fully designed in `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Extended Gameplay Systems — Encyclopedia":
- In-game encyclopedia with categories: Units, Structures, Weapons, Abilities, Terrain
- Each entry: name, description, sprite preview, stats table (HP, speed, cost, damage, range), prerequisite tree
- Populated from YAML definitions + `llm:` metadata when present
- Filtered by faction, searchable
- Asset browser is part of IC SDK (D040) — visual browsing/editing of sprites, palettes, terrain, sounds with format-aware import/export

## 38. Procedural Map Generation ⚠️ PARTIAL

**OpenRA:** `ClassicMapGenerator` (38KB) — procedural map generation with terrain types, resource placement, spawn points.

**Iron Curtain status:** Not explicitly designed as a standalone system, though multiple D038 features partially address this: game mode templates provide pre-configured map layouts, compositions provide reusable building blocks that could be randomly assembled, and the Probability of Presence system creates per-entity randomization. LLM-generated missions (Phase 7) provide full procedural generation when a provider is configured. A dedicated procedural map generator (terrain + resource placement + spawn balancing) is a natural Phase 7 addition to the scenario editor.

## 39. Localization / i18n ✅ DESIGNED

**OpenRA:** `FluentMessages` section in mod manifest — full localization support using Project Fluent.

**Iron Curtain status:** Fully designed in `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Extended Gameplay Systems — Localization Framework":
- Fluent-based (.ftl files) for parameterized messages and plural rules
- `Localization { current_locale, bundles }` resource
- String keys in YAML reference `fluent:key.name` — resolved at load time
- Mods provide their own `.ftl` translation files
- CJK/RTL font support via Bevy's font pipeline
- Language selection in settings UI
