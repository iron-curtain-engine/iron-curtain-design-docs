## State Recording & Replay Infrastructure

The sim's snapshottable design (D010) enables a **StateRecorder/Replayer** pattern for asynchronous background recording — inspired by Valve's Source Engine `StateRecorder`/`StateReplayer` pattern (see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 2.2). The game loop records orders and periodic state snapshots to a background writer; the replay system replays them through the same `Simulation::apply_tick()` path.

### StateRecorder (Recording Side)

```rust
/// Orchestrates background recording of game state to `.icrep` files.
/// Tick-order frames and keyframe snapshot blobs are sent as separate
/// messages to a `BackgroundReplayWriter` (see `network-model-trait.md`
/// § Background Replay Writer). The game thread produces per-tick
/// `ReplayTickFrame`s (cheap — just orders + hash) and periodic
/// keyframe blobs (more expensive — see cost model below).
///
/// Lives in ic-game (I/O concern, not sim concern — Invariant #1).
pub struct StateRecorder {
    /// Background writer that drains tick frames and keyframe blobs,
    /// performs LZ4 compression, and appends to the `.icrep` file.
    /// Crash-safe: Fossilize append-safe pattern (see D010).
    writer: BackgroundReplayWriter,
    /// Keyframe cadence: a keyframe blob is produced every this many ticks
    /// (default: 300 — ~20 seconds at the Slower default of ~15 tps).
    keyframe_interval: u64,
    /// Full snapshot cadence: every Nth keyframe is a full `SimSnapshot`
    /// instead of a `DeltaSnapshot` (default: N=10, i.e., every 3000 ticks).
    full_keyframe_every_n: u64,
    /// Baseline for delta keyframes — the last full SimCoreSnapshot.
    last_full_snapshot: SimCoreSnapshot,
    /// Last-known campaign state for delta comparison (None if no campaign active).
    last_campaign_state: Option<CampaignState>,
    /// Last-known script state for delta comparison (None before first keyframe).
    last_script_state: Option<ScriptState>,
}
```

**Per-tick recording** (every tick): `ic-game` constructs a `ReplayTickFrame { tick, state_hash, orders }` and calls `writer.record_tick(frame)`. Cost: negligible (the frame is a small struct; the background writer handles serialization and I/O).

**Keyframe recording** (every `keyframe_interval` ticks): `ic-game` produces the keyframe on the game thread in two steps — (1) `Simulation::delta_snapshot(&self.last_full_snapshot)` extracts a `SimCoreDelta`, (2) `ic-game` compares current campaign/script state against the recorder's `last_campaign_state` / `last_script_state` baselines and composes the full `DeltaSnapshot` (or `SimSnapshot` at full-keyframe cadence), including campaign/script state only if changed since the respective baselines. The composed snapshot is serialized to `Vec<u8>` and passed to `writer.record_keyframe(tick, is_full, blob)`. LZ4 compression and file I/O happen asynchronously on the background writer thread. After recording, the recorder updates its baselines: on full keyframes, all three baselines reset; on delta keyframes, only `last_campaign_state` and `last_script_state` are updated if they were included.

**Game-thread cost model:** Keyframe production costs ~1–1.5 ms per delta keyframe (every 300 ticks / ~20 seconds at Slower default) and ~2–3 ms per full keyframe (every 3000 ticks / ~200 seconds at Slower default) for a 500-unit game. This is well within the 67 ms tick budget (Slower default). The per-tick `record_tick()` call adds < 0.1 ms. LZ4 compression and disk I/O are fully async. See `formats/save-replay-formats.md` § Keyframe serialization threading for the full three-phase breakdown.

### Per-Field Change Tracking (from Source Engine CNetworkVar)

To support delta snapshots efficiently, the sim uses **per-field change tracking** — inspired by Source Engine's `CNetworkVar` system (see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 2.2). Each ECS component that participates in snapshotting is annotated with a `#[track_changes]` derive macro. The macro generates a companion bitfield that records which fields changed since the last snapshot. Delta serialization then skips unchanged fields entirely.

```rust
/// Derive macro that generates per-field change tracking for a component.
/// Each field gets a corresponding bit in a compact `ChangeMask` bitfield.
/// When a field is modified through its setter, the bit is set.
/// Delta serialization reads the mask to skip unchanged fields.
///
/// Components with SPROP_CHANGES_OFTEN (position, health, facing) are
/// checked first during delta computation — improves cache locality
/// by touching hot data before cold data. See `10-PERFORMANCE.md`.
#[derive(Component, Serialize, Deserialize, TrackChanges)]
pub struct Mobile {
    pub position: WorldPos,        // changes every tick during movement
    pub facing: FixedAngle,        // changes every tick during turning
    pub speed: FixedPoint,         // changes occasionally
    pub locomotor_type: Locomotor, // rarely changes
}

// Generated by #[derive(TrackChanges)]:
// impl Mobile {
//     pub fn set_position(&mut self, val: WorldPos) {
//         self.position = val;
//         self.change_mask |= 0b0001;
//     }
//     pub fn change_mask(&self) -> u8 { self.change_mask }
//     pub fn clear_changes(&mut self) { self.change_mask = 0; }
// }
```

**SPROP_CHANGES_OFTEN priority (from Source Engine):** Components that change frequently (position, health, ammunition) are tagged and processed first during delta encoding. This isn't a correctness concern — it's a cache locality optimization. By processing high-churn components first, the delta encoder touches frequently-modified memory regions while they're still in L1/L2 cache. See `10-PERFORMANCE.md` for performance impact analysis.

### Crash-Time State Capture

When a desync is detected (hash mismatch via `report_sync_hash()`), the system automatically captures a full state snapshot before any error handling or recovery:

```rust
/// Called by ic-game when a sync hash mismatch is detected.
/// Captures full composite state immediately — before the sim advances
/// further — so the exact divergence point is preserved for offline
/// analysis, including script-managed state that might be the root cause.
fn on_desync_detected(
    sim: &Simulation,
    script_engine: &ScriptEngine,   // ic-script handle (owned by ic-game)
    campaign: &CampaignState,
    tick: u64,
    local_hash: u64,
    remote_hash: u64,
) {
    // 1. Immediate sim core snapshot (SimCoreSnapshot — sim-internal state)
    let core = sim.snapshot();
    // 2. Collect external state so the dump includes script/campaign data.
    //    This mirrors the full SimSnapshot composition path used by saves
    //    and replay keyframes — if divergence is rooted in script state,
    //    the dump captures it.
    let script_state = script_engine.snapshot_all();
    let full = SimSnapshot {
        core,
        campaign_state: Some(campaign.clone()),
        script_state: Some(script_state),
    };
    // 3. Write to crash dump file (same Fossilize append-safe pattern)
    write_crash_dump(tick, local_hash, remote_hash, &full);
    // 4. If Merkle tree is available, capture the tree for
    //    logarithmic desync localization (see 03-NETCODE.md)
    if let Some(tree) = sim.merkle_tree() {
        write_merkle_dump(tick, &tree);
    }
    // 5. Continue with normal desync handling (reconnect, notify user, etc.)
}
```

This ensures desync debugging always has a snapshot at the exact point of divergence — not N ticks later when the developer gets around to analyzing it. The pattern comes from Valve's Fossilize (crash-safe state capture, see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 3.1) and OpenTTD's periodic desync snapshot naming convention (`desync_{seed}_{tick}.snap`).
