# Milestone Dependency Map (Execution Overlay)

Keywords: milestone dag, dependency graph, critical path, feature clusters, roadmap overlay, implementation order, hard dependency, soft dependency

> This page is the **detailed dependency companion** to [`../18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md`](../18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md). It does not replace [`../08-ROADMAP.md`](../08-ROADMAP.md); it translates roadmap phases and accepted decisions into an implementation-oriented milestone DAG and feature-cluster dependency map.

## Purpose

Use this page to answer:

- What blocks what?
- What can run in parallel?
- Which milestone exits require which feature clusters?
- Which policy/legal gates block validation even if code exists?
- Where do `Dxxx` decisions land in implementation order?

## Dependency Edge Kinds (Canonical)

| Edge Kind               | Meaning                                                                     | Example                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hard_depends_on`       | Cannot start meaningfully before predecessor exists                         | `M2` depends on `M1` (sim needs parsed rules + assets/render slice confidence)                                                |
| `soft_depends_on`       | Strongly preferred order; can parallelize with stubs                        | `M8` creator foundations benefit from `M3`, but can start after `M2`                                                          |
| `validation_depends_on` | Can prototype earlier, but cannot validate/exit without predecessor         | `M7` anti-cheat moderation UX can prototype before full signed replay chain, but validation depends on D052/D007 evidence     |
| `enables_parallel_work` | Unlocks a new independent lane                                              | `M2` enables `M8` creator foundation lane                                                                                     |
| `policy_gate`           | Legal/governance/security prerequisite                                      | DMCA agent registration before validating full Workshop upload ops                                                            |
| `integration_gate`      | Feature exists but must integrate with another system before milestone exit | D069 setup wizard + D068 selective install + D049 package verification before “ready” maintenance flow is considered complete |

## Critical Path Table (Recommended Baseline)

| Order | Milestone | Why It Is On the Critical Path                                                                                             |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `M1`      | Without format/resource fidelity and rendering confidence, sim correctness and game-feel validation are blind              |
| 2     | `M2`      | Deterministic simulation is the core dependency for skirmish, campaign, and multiplayer                                    |
| 3     | `M3`      | First playable local loop is the gateway to meaningful online and campaign runtime validation                              |
| 4     | `M4`      | Minimal online slice proves the netcode architecture in real conditions before productization                              |
| 5     | `M5`      | Campaign runtime slice de-risks the continuous flow/campaign graph stack                                                   |
| 6     | `M6`      | Full campaign completeness is a differentiator and prerequisite for final multiplayer-vs-campaign prioritization decisions |
| 7     | `M7`      | Ranked/trust/browser/spectator/community infra depend on both mature runtime and online vertical slice learnings           |
| 8     | `M8`      | Creator foundation can parallelize, but `M9` cannot exit without it                                                        |
| 9     | `M9`      | Scenario editor + full Workshop + export core unlock the authoring platform promise                                        |
| 10    | `M10`     | Campaign editor and advanced templates mature the content platform                                                         |
| 11    | `M11`     | Optional AI/LLM and platform polish should build on stabilized gameplay/multiplayer/editor foundations                     |

## Parallel Lanes (Planned)

| Lane                                 | Start After | Primary Scope    | Why Parallelizable                                                                                                                       |

| `Lane B: Campaign Runtime`           | `M3`        | `M5 -> M6`       | Reuses sim/game chrome while net productization proceeds                                                                                 |
| `Lane C: Creator Foundation`         | `M2`        | `M8`             | CLI/minimal Workshop/profile foundations can advance without full visual editor                                                          |
| `Lane C₂: P2P Engine`                | `M2`        | `M8 → M9`        | `p2p-distribute` standalone crate (D076 Tier 3); core engine through NAT/uTP needed for M8 Workshop delivery; full CAS/federation for M9 |
| `Lane D: Multiplayer Productization` | `M4 + M6`   | `M7`             | Needs runtime and net slice maturity plus content/gameplay maturity                                                                      |
| `Lane E: Authoring Platform`         | `M7 + M8`   | `M9 -> M10`      | Depends on productized runtime/networking and creator infra                                                                              |
| `Lane F: Optional AI/Polish`         | `M7 + M10`  | `M11`            | Optional systems should not steal bandwidth from core delivery                                                                           |
