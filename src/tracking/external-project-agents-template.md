# External Project `AGENTS.md` Template (Design-Aligned Implementation Repo)

Use this page to create an `AGENTS.md` file in an external implementation repo that depends on the Iron Curtain design docs.

This template is intentionally strict: it is designed to reduce design drift and make LLM-assisted implementation safer.

## Usage

1. Copy the template below into the external repo as `AGENTS.md`.
2. Fill in the placeholders (`<...>`).
3. Keep the design-doc links/version pin current.
4. Update in the same change set when milestone targets or code layout change.

## Template (copy into external repo root as `AGENTS.md`)

```md
# AGENTS.md — <PROJECT NAME>

> Local implementation rules for this code repository.
> Canonical design authority lives in the Iron Curtain design-doc repository.

## Canonical Design Authority (Do Not Override Locally)

This repository implements the Iron Curtain design. The canonical design sources are:

- Design docs repo: `<design-doc repo URL/path>`
- Design-doc baseline revision (pin this): `<tag|commit|date>`

Primary canonical planning and design references:

- `src/18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md` — execution overlay, milestone ordering, "what next?"
- `src/tracking/milestone-dependency-map.md` — dependency DAG and feature-cluster ordering
- `src/09-DECISIONS.md` — decision index (`Dxxx`)
- `src/02-ARCHITECTURE.md` / `src/03-NETCODE.md` / `src/04-MODDING.md` / `src/17-PLAYER-FLOW.md` (as applicable)
- `src/LLM-INDEX.md` — retrieval routing for humans/LLMs

## Non-Negotiable Rule: No Silent Design Divergence

If implementation reveals a missing detail, contradiction, or infeasible design path:

- do **not** silently invent a new canonical behavior
- open a design-gap/design-change request
- mark local work as one of:
  - `implementation placeholder`
  - `proposal-only`
  - `blocked on Pxxx`

If a design change is accepted, update the design-doc repo (or link to the accepted issue/PR) before treating it as settled.

## Implementation Overlay Discipline (Required)

Every feature implemented in this repo must reference the execution overlay.

Required in implementation issues/PRs:

- `Milestone:` `M0–M11`
- `Execution Step:` `G*`
- `Priority:` `P-*`
- `Dependencies:` relevant `Dxxx`, cluster IDs, `Pxxx` blockers
- `Evidence planned:` tests/demo/replay/profile/ops notes

Do not implement features out of sequence unless the dependency map says they can run in parallel.

## Source Code Navigation Index (Required)

This repo must maintain a code navigation file for humans and LLMs:

- `CODE-INDEX.md` (required filename)

It should document:

- directory/crate ownership
- public interfaces / trait seams
- hot paths / perf-sensitive areas
- test entry points
- related `Dxxx` decisions and `G*` steps
- "start here for X" routing notes

If the code layout changes, update `CODE-INDEX.md` in the same change set.

## Design Change Escalation Workflow

When you need a design change:

1. Open an issue/PR in the design-doc repo (or designated design tracker)
2. Include:
   - target `M#` / `G*`
   - affected code paths
   - affected canonical docs / `Dxxx`
   - why the current design is insufficient
   - proposed options and tradeoffs
3. **Document the divergence locally in this repo:**
   - a note in `docs/design-gap-requests/` (or equivalent local tracking path)
   - inline code comments at the divergence point referencing the issue and rationale
   - the full reasoning for why the original design was not followed
4. Link the request in the implementation PR/issue
5. Keep local workaround scope narrow until the design is resolved

## Local Repo-Specific Rules (Fill These In)

- Build/test commands: `<commands>`
- Formatting/lint commands: `<commands>`
- CI expectations: `<summary>`
- Perf profiling workflow (if any): `<summary>`
- Security constraints (if any): `<summary>`

## LLM / Agent Use Rules (Recommended)

- Read `CODE-INDEX.md` before broad codebase exploration
- Prefer targeted file reads over repo-wide scans once the index points to likely files
- Use canonical design docs for behavior decisions; use local code/docs for implementation specifics
- If docs and code conflict, treat this as a design-gap or stale-code-index problem and report it

### Code Module Structure for RAG Efficiency

Source code must be structured so LLM agents and RAG systems can retrieve and reason about modules efficiently — the same principle as the design-doc file size discipline, applied to code.

- **≤ 500 lines per logic file.** Over 800 lines → split. Data-definition files (struct-heavy deserialization, exhaustive tests) may exceed this; logic files may not.
- **≤ 40 lines per function** (target). Over 60 is a smell. Over 100 requires justification.
- **One concept per module.** If the filename needs a compound name (`foo_and_bar.rs`), it should be two files.
- **Module doc comment as routing header.** Every `.rs` file starts (after SPDX) with a `//!` doc comment explaining what the module does, its dependencies, and where it fits — an agent reads this (~50 tokens) to decide whether to load the full file.
- **`mod.rs` as barrel/hub.** Re-exports + summary doc comment. An agent reads the barrel to route to the right submodule without loading siblings.
- **Self-contained context ("Dropped In" test).** Each file restates enough context (system ordering, invariants, cross-module interactions) that an agent can reason about it in isolation.
- **Greppable names.** Same term for the same concept across all files. An agent searching for a concept must find it everywhere it appears.
- **Trait files are routing indexes.** Trait definition files doc-comment each method with enough context for an agent to decide whether it needs the trait or an implementation.

**Why:** A 500-line Rust file ≈ 1,500–2,500 tokens. An agent can load 3–5 related files and still reason. An 1,800-line file ≈ 6,000 tokens — it crowds out context for everything else. RAG retrieval works best with self-contained, well-labeled, single-topic chunks. See design-doc `AGENTS.md` § Code Module Structure and `src/coding-standards/quality-review.md` § File Size Guideline.

## Evidence Rule (Implementation Progress Claims)

Do not claim a feature is complete without evidence:

- tests
- replay/demo capture
- logs/profiles
- CI output
- manual verification notes (if no automation exists yet)

## Current Implementation Target (Update Regularly)

- Active milestone: `<M#>`
- Active `G*` steps: `<G# ...>`
- Current blockers (`Pxxx`, external): `<...>`
- Parallel work lanes allowed: `<...>`
```

## Notes

- This template is intentionally general so it works for engine repos, tools repos, relay/server repos, or prototypes.
- The external repo may add local rules, but it should not weaken the "no silent divergence" or overlay-mapping rules.

## Execution Overlay Mapping

- **Milestone:** `M0`
- **Priority:** `P-Core`
- **Feature Cluster:** `M0.OPS.EXTERNAL_CODE_REPO_BOOTSTRAP_AND_NAVIGATION_TEMPLATES`
- **Depends on:** `M0.CORE.TRACKER_FOUNDATION`, `M0.CORE.DEP_GRAPH_SCHEMA`, `M0.OPS.MAINTENANCE_RULES`, `M0.QA.CI_PIPELINE_FOUNDATION`
