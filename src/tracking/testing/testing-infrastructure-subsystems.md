## Test Infrastructure Requirements

### Custom Test Harness (`ic-test-harness`)

A dedicated crate providing:

```rust
/// Run a deterministic sim scenario and return the final state hash.
pub fn run_scenario(scenario: &Scenario, seed: u64) -> SyncHash;

/// Run the same scenario N times and assert all hashes match.
pub fn assert_deterministic(scenario: &Scenario, seed: u64, runs: usize);

/// Run a scenario with a known-cheat replay and assert detection fires.
pub fn assert_cheat_detected(replay: &ReplayFile, expected: CheatType);

/// Run a scenario with a known-clean replay and assert no flags.
pub fn assert_no_false_positive(replay: &ReplayFile);

/// Run a scenario with deliberate desync injection and assert detection.
pub fn assert_desync_detected(scenario: &Scenario, desync_at: SimTick);

/// Run a scenario and measure tick time, returning percentile statistics.
pub fn benchmark_scenario(scenario: &Scenario, ticks: usize) -> TickStats;

/// Run a scenario and assert zero heap allocations in the hot path.
pub fn assert_zero_alloc_hot_path(scenario: &Scenario, ticks: usize);

/// Run a scenario with a sandbox module and assert all escape vectors are blocked.
pub fn assert_sandbox_contained(module: &WasmModule, escape_vectors: &[EscapeVector]);

/// Run order validation and assert sim state hash is unchanged (purity check).
pub fn assert_validation_pure(snap: &SimCoreSnapshot, orders: &[PlayerOrder]);

/// Run two sim instances with identical input and assert hash match at every tick.
pub fn assert_twin_determinism(scenario: &Scenario, seed: u64, ticks: usize);

/// Run the same scenario on the current platform and compare hash against
/// a stored cross-platform reference hash.
pub fn assert_cross_platform_hash(scenario: &Scenario, reference: &HashFile);

/// Run snapshot round-trip and assert state identity via hash comparison.
/// Takes a snapshot, restores it into a fresh sim, and verifies that
/// `state_hash()` matches the original — state identity, not byte-exactness.
pub fn assert_snapshot_roundtrip(snap: &SimCoreSnapshot);

/// Run a campaign mission sequence and verify roster carryover.
pub fn assert_roster_carryover(campaign: &CampaignGraph, mission_sequence: &[MissionId]);

/// Run a mod loading scenario and verify sandbox limits are enforced.
pub fn assert_mod_sandbox_limits(mod_path: &Path, limits: &SandboxLimits);
```

### Tick Statistics (`TickStats`)

```rust
/// Per-scenario benchmark output — all values in microseconds.
pub struct TickStats {
    pub p50: u64,
    pub p95: u64,
    pub p99: u64,
    pub max: u64,
    pub heap_allocs: u64,      // total heap allocations during measurement window
    pub peak_rss_bytes: u64,   // peak resident set size
}
```

### Performance Benchmark Suite (`ic-bench`)

Using `criterion` for statistical benchmarks with regression detection:

| Benchmark                                       | Budget          | Regression Threshold   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sim tick (100 units)                            | < 2ms           | +10% = warning         |
| Sim tick (1000 units)                           | < 10ms          | +10% = warning         |
| Pathfinding (A*, 256x256)                       | < 1ms           | +20% = warning         |
| Fog-of-war update                               | < 0.5ms         | +15% = warning         |
| Network serialization                           | < 0.1ms/message | +10% = warning         |
| YAML config load                                | < 50ms          | +25% = warning         |
| Replay frame write                              | < 0.05ms/frame  | +20% = warning         |
| Pathfinding LOD transition (256x256, 500 units) | < 0.25ms        | +15% = warning         |
| Stagger schedule overhead (1000 units)          | < 2.5ms         | +15% = warning         |
| Spatial hash query (1M entities, 8K result)     | < 1ms           | +20% = warning         |
| Flowfield generation (256x256)                  | < 0.5ms         | +15% = warning         |
| ECS cache miss rate (hot tick loop)             | < 5% L1 misses  | +2% absolute = warning |
| Weather state update (full map)                 | < 0.3ms         | +20% = warning         |
| Merkle tree hash (32 archetypes)                | < 0.2ms         | +15% = warning         |
| Order validation (256 orders/tick)              | < 0.5ms         | +10% = warning         |

**Allocation tracking:** Hot-path benchmarks also measure heap allocations. Any allocation in a previously zero-alloc path is a test failure.

### Labeled Replay Corpus

For anti-cheat calibration (V54):

| Category            | Source                                   | Minimum Count |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Confirmed-cheat     | Test accounts with known cheat tools     | 500 replays   |
| Confirmed-clean     | Tournament players, manually verified    | 2000 replays  |
| Edge-case           | High-APM legitimate players (pro gamers) | 200 replays   |
| Bot-assisted        | Known automation scripts                 | 100 replays   |
| Platform-bug desync | Reproduced cross-platform desyncs (V55)  | 50 replays    |

The labeled corpus is a living dataset — confirmed cases from post-launch human review (V54 continuous calibration) are ingested automatically. Quarterly corpus audits verify partition hygiene (no mislabeled replays, stale entries archived after 12 months).

### Population Baseline Validation

For population-baseline statistical comparison (V12):

| Test                    | Method                                                          | Pass Criteria                                                       | CI Tier |

| Per-tier separation     | Generate profiles with distinct per-tier distributions          | Baselines for each rating tier differ meaningfully                  | T2      |
| Recalculation stability | Recompute baselines on overlapping windows with <5% data change | Baselines shift <2% between recomputations                          | T3      |
| Outlier vs population   | Inject synthetic outlier profiles (APM 2000+, reaction <40ms)   | Outliers flagged by population comparison AND hard-floor thresholds | T2      |

### Trust Score Validation

For behavioral matchmaking trust score (V12):

| Test                  | Method                                                 | Pass Criteria                                                     | CI Tier |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Factor computation    | Seed player history db, compute trust score            | Score within expected range for known-good/known-bad profiles     | T2      |
| Matchmaking influence | Queue 100 synthetic players with varied trust scores   | High-trust players grouped preferentially with high-trust         | T3      |
| Recovery rate         | Simulate clean play after trust score drop             | Score recovers at defined asymmetric rate (slower gain than loss) | T2      |
| Community scoping     | Compute trust across two independent community servers | Scores are independent per community (no cross-community leakage) | T2      |

## Subsystem Test Specifications

Detailed test specifications organized by subsystem. Each entry defines: what is tested, test method, pass criteria, and CI tier.

### Simulation Fairness (D008)

| Test                              | Method                                                                                       | Pass Criteria                                                                        | Tier               |
