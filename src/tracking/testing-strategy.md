# Testing Strategy & CI/CD Pipeline

This document defines the automated testing infrastructure for Iron Curtain. Every design feature must map to at least one automated verification method. Testing is not an afterthought — it is a design constraint.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Determinism is testable.** If a system is deterministic (Invariant #1), its behavior can be reproduced exactly. Tests that rely on determinism are the strongest tests we have.
2. **No untested exit criteria.** Every milestone exit criterion (see 18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md) must have a corresponding automated test. If a criterion cannot be tested automatically, it must be flagged as a manual review gate.
3. **CI is the authority.** If CI passes, the code is shippable. If CI fails, the code does not merge. No exceptions, no "it works on my machine."
4. **Fast feedback, thorough verification.** PR gates must complete in <10 minutes. Nightly suites handle expensive verification. Weekly suites cover exhaustive/long-running scenarios.

## CI/CD Pipeline Tiers

### Tier 1: PR Gate (every pull request, <10 min)

| Test Category           | What It Verifies                                                       | Tool / Framework         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `cargo clippy --all`    | Lint compliance, `disallowed_types` enforcement (see coding standards) | clippy                   |
| `cargo test`            | Unit tests across all crates                                           | cargo test               |
| `cargo fmt --check`     | Formatting consistency                                                 | rustfmt                  |
| Determinism smoke test  | 100-tick sim with fixed seed → hash match across runs                  | custom harness           |
| WASM sandbox smoke test | Basic WASM module load/execute/capability check                        | custom harness           |
| Lua sandbox smoke test  | Basic Lua script load/execute/resource-limit check                     | custom harness           |
| YAML schema validation  | All game data YAML files pass schema validation                        | custom validator         |
| `strict-path` boundary  | Path boundary enforcement for all untrusted-input APIs                 | unit tests               |
| Build (all targets)     | Cross-compilation succeeds (Linux, Windows, macOS)                     | cargo build / CI matrix  |
| Doc link check          | All internal doc cross-references resolve                              | mdbook build + linkcheck |

**Gate rule:** All Tier 1 tests must pass. Merge is blocked on any failure.

### Tier 2: Post-Merge (after merge to main, <30 min)

| Test Category           | What It Verifies                                              | Tool / Framework                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Integration tests       | Cross-crate interactions (ic-sim ↔ ic-game ↔ ic-script)       | cargo test --features integration |
| Determinism full suite  | 10,000-tick sim with 8 players, all unit types → hash match   | custom harness                    |
| Network protocol tests  | Lobby join/leave, relay handshake, reconnection, session auth | custom harness + tokio            |
| Replay round-trip       | Record game → playback → hash match with original             | custom harness                    |
| Workshop package verify | Package build → sign → upload → download → verify chain       | custom harness                    |
| Anti-cheat smoke test   | Known-cheat replay → detection fires; known-clean → no flag   | custom harness                    |
| Memory safety (Miri)    | Undefined behavior detection in unsafe blocks                 | cargo miri test                   |

**Gate rule:** Failures trigger automatic revert of the merge commit and notification to the PR author.

| Cross-platform determinism | Same scenario on Linux + Windows → identical hash               | CI matrix comparison   |
| Unicode/BiDi sanitization  | RTL/BiDi QA corpus (rtl-bidi-qa-corpus.md) categories A–I       | custom harness         |
| Display name validation    | UTS #39 confusable corpus → all impersonation attempts blocked  | custom harness         |
