## Canonical Design Authority (Do Not Override Locally)

This repository implements the Iron Curtain design. The canonical design sources are:

- Design docs repo: `https://github.com/AE26/iron-curtain-design-docs`
- Design-doc baseline revision: `HEAD` (pin to a specific tag/commit at bootstrap time)

Primary canonical planning and design references:

- `src/18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md` — execution overlay, milestone ordering, "what next?"
- `src/tracking/milestone-dependency-map.md` — dependency DAG and feature-cluster ordering
- `src/09-DECISIONS.md` — decision index (`Dxxx`)
- `src/02-ARCHITECTURE.md` — crate structure, sim/net/render architecture, determinism invariants
- `src/03-NETCODE.md` — relay protocol, `NetworkModel` trait, sub-tick fairness, anti-cheat
- `src/04-MODDING.md` — YAML → Lua → WASM modding tiers, sandbox boundaries
- `src/06-SECURITY.md` — threat model, trust boundaries, anti-cheat mitigations
- `src/17-PLAYER-FLOW.md` — UI navigation, screen flow, platform adaptations
- `src/architecture/type-safety.md` — newtype policy, fixed-point math, typestate, verified wrappers
- `src/architecture/crate-graph.md` — crate dependency DAG, async architecture, IoBridge trait
- `src/LLM-INDEX.md` — retrieval routing for humans/LLMs

## Non-Negotiable Rule: No Silent Design Divergence

If implementation reveals a missing detail, contradiction, or infeasible design path:

- do **not** silently invent a new canonical behavior
- open a design-gap/design-change request (see escalation workflow below)
- document the divergence rationale locally in `docs/design-gap-requests/`
- mark local work as one of:
  - `implementation placeholder`
  - `proposal-only`
  - `blocked on Pxxx`

If a design change is accepted, update the design-doc repo (or link to the accepted issue/PR) before treating it as settled.

## Non-Negotiable Architectural Invariants

These invariants are settled design decisions. Violating them is a bug, not a tradeoff.

### Invariant 1: Simulation is Pure and Deterministic

- `ic-sim` performs **no I/O** — no file access, no network calls, no system clock reads
- **Fixed-point math only** — `i32`/`i64` with scale factor 1024 (P002 resolved). Never `f32`/`f64` in sim-facing code
- **No HashMap/HashSet** — non-deterministic iteration order breaks lockstep. Use `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`/`IndexMap`
- Same inputs → identical outputs on all platforms, all compilers, all OSes
- **Enforcement:** `clippy::disallowed_types` in CI catches `f32`, `f64`, `HashMap`, `HashSet` in `ic-sim`

Related decisions: D009, D010, D012, D013, D015

### Invariant 2: Network Model is Pluggable via Trait

- `GameLoop<N: NetworkModel, I: InputSource>` is generic over both network and input
- `ic-sim` has **zero imports** from `ic-net` (and vice versa) — they share only `ic-protocol`
- Swapping lockstep for rollback touches zero sim code
- Shipping implementations: `RelayLockstepNetwork`, `LocalNetwork` (testing), `ReplayPlayback`

Related decisions: D006, D007, D008

### Invariant 3: Modding is Tiered (YAML → Lua → WASM)

- Each tier is optional and sandboxed
- No C# runtime, no recompilation required
- YAML for data (80% of mods), Lua for scripting (missions, abilities), WASM for total conversions
- WASM sandbox uses capability-based API — mods cannot request data outside their fog-filtered view

Related decisions: D004, D005, D023, D024, D025, D026

### Invariant 4: Every ID is a Wrapped Newtype

- Never use bare integers for domain IDs (`PlayerId(u32)`, not `u32`)
- Crypto hashes only constructible via compute functions (`Fingerprint::compute()`)
- State machines use typestate pattern — invalid transitions are compile errors
- Post-verification data uses `Verified<T>` wrapper — only verification functions can construct it
- Network messages branded with direction: `FromClient<T>`, `FromServer<T>`

Related decisions: type-safety invariants in `src/architecture/type-safety.md`

### Invariant 5: UI Never Mutates Authoritative Sim State

- `ic-ui` reads sim state through `SimReadView` (fog-filtered, read-only)
- UI emits `PlayerOrder` values that flow through the order pipeline
- Sim applies validated orders during `apply_tick()` — never directly from UI

| `ic-sim`         | Pure deterministic simulation (fixed-point, no I/O, no floats)                                               | 2     |

**Critical crate boundaries:**

- `ic-sim` never imports `ic-net`, `ic-render`, `ic-ui`, `ic-audio`, `ic-editor`
- `ic-net` library never imports `ic-sim`
- `ic-server` is a top-level binary (like `ic-game`) that depends on `ic-net` for RelayCore and optionally `ic-sim` for FogAuth/relay-headless (D074)
- `ic-sim` and `ic-net` share only `ic-protocol`
- `ic-game` never imports `ic-editor` (separate binaries, shared libraries)
- `ic-sim` never reads/writes SQLite directly

## Implementation Overlay Discipline (Required)

Every feature implemented in this repo must reference the execution overlay.

Required in implementation issues/PRs:

- `Milestone:` `M0–M11`
- `Execution Step:` `G*`
- `Priority:` `P-Core` / `P-Differentiator` / `P-Creator` / `P-Scale` / `P-Optional`
- `Feature Spec Refs:` `F-*` (or `—`)
- `Screen Spec Refs:` `SCR-*` (or `—`)
- `Scenario Refs:` `SCEN-*` (or `—`)
- `Dependencies:` relevant `Dxxx`, cluster IDs, `Pxxx` blockers
- `Evidence planned:` tests/demo/replay/profile/ops notes

Do not implement features out of sequence unless the dependency map says they can run in parallel.

## Source Code Navigation Index (Required)

This repo must maintain a code navigation file for humans and LLMs:

- `CODE-INDEX.md` (required filename)

See the filled-in template in the design docs at `src/tracking/ic-engine-code-index.md` for the initial version to copy.

Update `CODE-INDEX.md` in the same change set when code layout changes.

## Design Change Escalation Workflow

When implementation reveals a conflict with canonical design docs:

1. Open an issue/PR in the design-doc repo (or designated design tracker) labeled `design-gap` or `design-contradiction`
2. Include:
   - target `M#` / `G*`
   - affected code paths and crates
   - affected canonical docs / `Dxxx` decisions
   - concrete conflict or missing "how"
   - proposed options and tradeoffs
   - impact on milestones/dependencies/priority
3. Document the divergence rationale locally:
   - a note in `docs/design-gap-requests/` with full reasoning
   - inline code comments at the divergence point referencing the issue
4. Link the request in the implementation PR/issue
5. Keep local workaround scope narrow until the design is resolved
6. If accepted, update the design-doc tracker/overlay in the same planning pass

### What Counts as a Design Gap

Open a request when:

- the docs specify *what* but not enough *how* for the target `G*` step
- two canonical docs disagree on behavior
- a new dependency/ordering constraint is discovered
- a feature requires a new policy/trust/legal decision (`Pxxx`)
- implementation experience shows a documented approach is not viable or perf-safe

Do **not** open a request for:

- local refactors that preserve behavior/invariants
- code organization improvements internal to one crate
- test harness additions that do not change accepted design behavior

## Local Repo-Specific Rules

- **Language:** Rust (2021 edition)
- **Build:** `cargo build --workspace`
- **Test:** `cargo test --workspace`
- **Lint:** `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
- **Format:** `cargo fmt --all --check`
- **CI expectations:** All tests pass, clippy clean (zero warnings), fmt check clean. `clippy::disallowed_types` enforces determinism rules in `ic-sim`
- **Perf profiling:** `cargo bench` for hot-path microbenchmarks; Tracy/Superluminal for frame profiling
- **Security constraints:** No `unsafe` without review comment. WASM mods use capability-gated API only (D005). Order validation is deterministic (D012). Replay hashes use Ed25519 signing (D010)

## LLM / Agent Use Rules

- Read `CODE-INDEX.md` before broad codebase exploration
- Prefer targeted file reads over repo-wide scans once the index points to likely files
- Use canonical design docs (linked above) for behavior decisions; use local code/docs for implementation specifics
- If docs and code conflict, treat this as a design-gap or stale-code-index problem and report it — do not silently override
- Never introduce `f32`/`f64`/`HashMap`/`HashSet` in `ic-sim` — CI will reject it
- Never add I/O (file, network, clock) to `ic-sim`
- Never add `ic-net` imports to `ic-sim` or `ic-sim` imports to `ic-net`

## Evidence Rule (Implementation Progress Claims)

Do not claim a feature is complete without evidence:

- tests (unit, integration, or conformance)
- replay/demo capture demonstrating the feature
- benchmark results for perf-sensitive paths
- CI output showing clean build + test pass
- manual verification notes (if no automation exists yet)

## Current Implementation Target (Update Regularly)

- Active milestone: `M1`
- Active `G*` steps: `G1` (RA asset parsing), `G2` (Bevy isometric render), `G3` (unit animation)
- Current blockers: none known
- Parallel work lanes allowed: `G1` and `G2` can overlap (parser feeds renderer)

## Execution Overlay Mapping

- **Milestone:** `M0`
- **Priority:** `P-Core` (process-critical implementation hygiene)
- **Feature Cluster:** `M0.OPS.EXTERNAL_CODE_REPO_BOOTSTRAP_AND_NAVIGATION_TEMPLATES`
- **Depends on (hard):** `M0.CORE.TRACKER_FOUNDATION`, `M0.CORE.DEP_GRAPH_SCHEMA`, `M0.OPS.MAINTENANCE_RULES`, `M0.QA.CI_PIPELINE_FOUNDATION`
