# Modding System  Campaign System (Branching, Persistent, Continuous)

*Inspired by Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis / Resistance. See D021.*

OpenRA's campaigns are disconnected: each mission is standalone, you exit to menu between them, there's no flow. Our campaigns are **continuous, branching, and stateful** — a directed graph of missions with persistent state, multiple outcomes per mission, and no mandatory game-over screen.

### Core Principles

1. **Campaign is a graph, not a list.** Missions connect via named outcomes, forming branches, convergence points, and optional paths — not a linear sequence.
2. **Missions have multiple outcomes, not just win/lose.** "Won with bridge intact" and "Won but bridge destroyed" are different outcomes that lead to different next missions.
3. **Failure doesn't end the campaign.** A "defeat" outcome is just another edge in the graph. The designer chooses: branch to a fallback mission, retry with fewer resources, or skip ahead with consequences. "No game over" campaigns are possible.
4. **State persists across missions.** Surviving units, veterancy, captured equipment, story flags, resources — all carry forward based on designer-configured carryover rules.
5. **Continuous flow.** Briefing → mission → debrief → next mission. No exit to menu between levels (unless the player explicitly quits).

### Campaign Definition (YAML)

```yaml

  # These are the campaign's baked-in configuration — what the author
  # intends the campaign to play like. Applied as defaults when the
  # player starts a new playthrough; player can review and tweak
  # individual switches before launching.

```

This is a **directed acyclic graph** (with optional cycles for retry loops). The engine validates campaign graphs at load time: no orphan nodes, all outcome targets exist, start mission is defined.

### Campaign Graph Extensions (Optional Side Missions)

Campaign graphs are extensible — external mods can inject new mission nodes into an existing campaign's graph without modifying the original campaign files. This enables:

1. **First-party expansion content** — IC ships optional "Enhanced Campaign" missions that branch off the original RA1/TD campaign graph, using IC's new mechanics (hero progression, branching, dynamic weather, asymmetric co-op) while the classic missions remain untouched
2. **Community side missions** — Workshop authors publish side-mission packs that attach to specific points in official or community campaigns
3. **Campaign DLC pattern** — new story arcs that branch off after specific missions and rejoin (or don't) later in the original graph

**How it works:** Campaign extensions use the same YAML graph format as primary campaigns but declare an `extends` field pointing to the parent campaign. The engine merges the extension graph into the parent at load time.

```yaml
# Extension campaign — adds optional side missions to the Allied campaign
campaign:
  id: allied_campaign_enhanced
  extends: allied_campaign               # parent campaign this extends

  # Extension metadata
  title: "Allied Campaign — Enhanced Edition"
  description: "Optional missions exploring new IC mechanics alongside the classic Allied campaign"
  optional: true                         # player can enable/disable in campaign settings
  badge: "IC Enhanced"                   # shown in mission select to distinguish extended content

  # New missions that attach to the parent graph
  missions:
    # Side mission: branches off after allied_03 as an OPTIONAL path
    allied_03_tanya_ops:
      extends_from:
        parent_mission: allied_03        # attach point in the parent campaign
        parent_outcome: victory          # which outcome edge to branch from
        insertion: optional_branch       # 'optional_branch' = new choice, not replacement
      map: missions/enhanced/tanya_ops_01
      briefing: briefings/enhanced/tanya_ops_01.yaml
      badge: "IC Enhanced"               # UI badge distinguishing this from original missions
      type: embedded_task_force          # uses new IC mission archetype
      hero: tanya
      outcomes:
        victory:
          next: allied_04                # rejoin the original campaign graph
          state_effects:
            set_flag:
              tanya_ops_complete: true
              tanya_reputation: hero
        defeat:
          next: allied_04                # still continues — side mission failure isn't campaign-ending
          state_effects:
            set_flag:
              tanya_ops_failed: true

    # Side mission: available only if the player chose a specific path
    allied_06_spy_network:
      extends_from:
        parent_mission: allied_06
        parent_outcome: victory
        insertion: optional_branch
        condition:                       # only available if a specific flag is set
          require_flag:
            tanya_ops_complete: true
      map: missions/enhanced/spy_network
      type: spy_infiltration
      outcomes:
        victory:
          next: allied_07
          state_effects:
            set_flag:
              spy_network_active: true

    # Replacement mission: same graph position but uses new IC mechanics
    allied_05_remastered:
      extends_from:
        parent_mission: allied_05
        insertion: alternative            # 'alternative' = offered alongside the original
        label: "Enhanced Version"         # shown in mission select
      map: missions/enhanced/allied_05_remastered
      type: embedded_task_force           # new IC archetype instead of classic scripting
      outcomes:
        victory:
          next: allied_06                 # same destination as original
        defeat:
          next: allied_05_fallback        # same fallback as original
```

**Insertion modes:**

| Mode | Behavior | UX |
|------|----------|-----|
| `optional_branch` | Adds a new choice alongside existing outcome edges. Player can take the side mission or continue the original path. If the side mission is skipped, the original graph is unchanged | Mission select shows: "Continue to Mission 4" / "Side Mission: Tanya Ops (IC Enhanced)" |
| `alternative` | Offers an alternative version of an existing mission. Player chooses between original and enhanced. Both lead to the same next-mission targets | Mission select shows: "Mission 5 (Classic)" / "Mission 5 (Enhanced Version)" |
| `insert_before` | Adds a new mission that must be completed before the original mission. The extension mission's victory outcome leads to the original mission | The new mission appears in the graph between the parent and its original next mission |
| `post_campaign` | Attaches after the campaign's ending node(s). Extends the story beyond the original ending | Available after campaign completion. Shows as "Epilogue: ..." |

Some first-party plans may intentionally keep a branch pending across a bounded future window, such as a rescue mission that remains available for the next one or two nodes while penalties escalate. That is an explicit campaign-layer extension, not implicit behavior of every `optional_branch`.
When this happens, the campaign map/intermission UI may show multiple available missions at once. `Continue Campaign` should reopen that campaign map/intermission state rather than auto-launching an arbitrary node.

**Graph merge at load time:**

1. Engine loads the parent campaign graph (e.g., `allied_campaign`)
2. Engine scans for installed campaign extensions that declare `extends: allied_campaign`
3. For each enabled extension, the engine validates:
   - `parent_mission` exists in the parent graph
   - `parent_outcome` is a valid outcome for that mission
   - No conflicting insertions (two extensions trying to `insert_before` the same mission)
   - Extension missions don't create graph cycles
4. Extension missions are merged into the combined graph with their `badge` metadata
5. The combined graph is what the player sees in mission select

**Player control:**

- Extensions are **opt-in**. The campaign settings screen shows installed extensions with toggle switches:
  ```
  Allied Campaign
    ✅ Classic missions (always on)
    🔲 IC Enhanced Edition — optional side missions using new mechanics
    🔲 Community: "Tanya Chronicles" by MapMaster — 5 additional commando missions
  ```
- Disabling an extension removes its missions from the graph. The original campaign is always playable without any extensions
- Campaign progress (D021 `CampaignState`) tracks which extension missions were completed, so enabling/disabling extensions mid-campaign is safe — completed extension missions remain in history, and the player continues from wherever they are in the original graph

**Workshop support:** Campaign extensions are Workshop packages (D030/D049) with `type = "campaign_extension"` in their `mod.toml`. The Workshop listing shows which parent campaign they extend. Installing an extension automatically associates it with the parent campaign in the mission select UI.

```toml
# mod.toml for a campaign extension
[mod]
id = "allied-enhanced"
title = "Allied Campaign — Enhanced Edition"
type = "campaign_extension"
extends_campaign = "allied_campaign"    # which campaign this extends

[dependencies]
"official/ra1" = "^1.0"               # requires the base RA1 module
```

### First-Party Enhanced Campaigns (IC Enhanced Edition)

IC ships the classic RA1 Allied and Soviet campaigns faithfully reproduced (Phase 4). Alongside them, IC offers an **optional "Enhanced Edition"** — a campaign extension that weaves Counterstrike/Aftermath expansion missions into the main campaign graph, adds IC-original missions showcasing new mechanics, and introduces branching decisions. Like XCOM: Enemy Within to Enemy Unknown, or Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition — the same campaign, but richer.

**Guiding principle:** The classic campaign is always available untouched. Enhanced Edition is opt-in. A player who wants the 1996 experience gets it. A player who wants to see what a modern engine adds enables the extension. Both are first-class.

#### What the Enhanced Edition Adds

**1. Counterstrike & Aftermath missions integrated into the campaign graph**

The original expansion packs (Counterstrike: 16 missions, Aftermath: 18 missions) shipped as standalone, play-in-any-order mission sets with no campaign integration. The Enhanced Edition places them into the main campaign graph at chronologically appropriate points, as optional side missions:

```
Classic Allied Campaign (linear):
  A01 → A02 → A03 → A04 → ... → A14

Enhanced Edition (branching, with expansion missions woven in):
  A01 → A02 → A03 ─┬─ A04 → A05 ─┬─ A06 → ...
                    │              │
                    └─ CS-A03      └─ AM-A02
                    (Counterstrike  (Aftermath
                     side mission,   side mission,
                     optional)       optional)
```

Some expansion missions become alternative versions of main missions (offering the enhanced IC version alongside the classic). Some become side-mission branches that the player can take or skip. A few become mandatory in the Enhanced Edition flow where they fill narrative gaps.

**2. IC-original missions showcasing platform capabilities**

New missions designed specifically to demonstrate what IC's engine can do that the original couldn't:

| IC Feature | Enhanced Edition Mission | What It Demonstrates |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Hero progression (D021)** | "Tanya: First Blood" — a prologue mission before A01 where Tanya earns her first skill points | Hero XP, skill tree, persistent progression across the entire campaign |
| **Embedded task force (§ Special Ops Archetypes)** | "Evidence: Enhanced" — Tanya + squad operate inside a live battle around the facility approach | Hero-in-battle gameplay: live AI-vs-AI combat around the player's special ops objectives |
| **Branching decisions** | After M10A, choose: classic interior raid, embedded task-force variant, or commander-led siege | Multiple paths with different rewards and persistent consequences |
| **Air campaign** | "Operation Skyfall" — coordinate air strikes and recon flights supporting a ground resistance attack | Air commander gameplay: sortie management, target designation, no base building |
| **Spy infiltration** | "Behind Enemy Lines" — Tanya infiltrates a Soviet facility for Iron Curtain intel | Detection/alert system, sabotage effects weakening later Soviet operations |
| **Dynamic weather (D022)** | "Protect the Chronosphere" — a storm rolls in during the defense, reducing visibility and slowing vehicles | Weather as gameplay: the battlefield changes mid-mission, not just visually |
| **Asymmetric co-op (D070, Phase 6b add-on)** | "Joint Operations" — optional co-op variant where Player 1 is Commander (base) and Player 2 is SpecOps (Tanya's squad) | The full Commander & SpecOps experience within the campaign once D070 ships |
| **Campaign menu scenes** | Each act changes the main menu background — Act 1: naval convoy, Act 2: night air patrol, Act 3: ground assault, Victory: sunrise over liberated city | Evolving title screen tied to campaign progress |
| **Unit roster carryover (D021)** | Surviving units from "Tanya: First Blood" appear in A01 as veteran reinforcements | Persistent roster: lose a unit and they're gone for the rest of the campaign |
| **Failure as branching** | If "Behind Enemy Lines" fails, Tanya is captured and the rescue branch can stay pending for a bounded window while penalties escalate; ignoring it leaves permanent consequences | No game-over screen: failure changes the next branch and mission conditions instead of forcing a reload |

**3. Decision points that create campaign variety**

At key moments, the Enhanced Edition offers the player a choice:

```yaml
# Example: after completing mission A05, the player chooses
missions:
  allied_05:
    outcomes:
      victory:
        # Enhanced Edition adds a decision point here
        decision:
          prompt: "Command has two plans for the next phase."
          choices:
            - label: "Frontal Assault (Classic)"
              description: "Attack the Soviet base directly with full armor support."
              next: allied_06                    # original mission
              badge: "Classic"
            - label: "Sewer Infiltration (Enhanced)"
              description: "Send Tanya through the sewers to sabotage the base from within before the assault."
              next: allied_05b_infiltration      # new IC mission
              badge: "IC Enhanced"
              requires_hero: tanya               # only available if Tanya is alive
            - label: "Air Strike First (Counterstrike)"
              description: "Soften the target with a bombing campaign before committing ground forces."
              next: cs_allied_04                 # Counterstrike expansion mission
              badge: "Counterstrike"
              unchosen_effects:
                set_flag:
                  air_strike_window_missed: true
```

Choices may optionally define `unchosen_effects` on individual entries. When the player picks one branch, the engine applies the `unchosen_effects` from every branch not taken. This lets authors build XCOM-style "the world moved without you" decision points using the same D021 `decision` primitive instead of inventing a separate timed-choice node.

**4. Expansion mission enhancements**

When Counterstrike/Aftermath missions are played within the Enhanced Edition, they gain IC features they didn't originally have:

- **Briefing/debrief flow** — continuous narrative instead of standalone mission select
- **Roster carryover** — units from the previous mission carry over (the originals had no persistence)
- **Weather effects** — maps gain dynamic weather appropriate to their setting (Italian missions get Mediterranean sun; Polish missions get winter conditions)
- **Veterancy** — units earn experience and carry it forward
- **Multiple outcomes** — original missions had win/lose; Enhanced Edition adds alternative victory conditions ("won with low casualties" → bonus reinforcements next mission)

**5. Ideas drawn from other successful enhanced editions**

| Source | What They Did | IC Application |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **XCOM: Enemy Within** | Added new resources (Meld), new soldier class (MEC), new mission types woven into the same campaign timeline. Toggleable mission chains (Operation Progeny) | IC adds new resource mechanics (hero XP), new mission types (task force, air campaign, spy infiltration) woven into RA1 timeline. Each chain is toggleable |
| **Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition** | Added 3 new companion characters with unique quest lines that interleave with the main story. New arena mode. QoL improvements | IC adds Tanya hero progression as a "companion" quest line threading through the campaign. Highlight reel POTG after each mission |
| **StarCraft: Brood War** | "Final Fantasy type events" during missions — scripted narrative beats within gameplay. Tactical decisions over which objectives to pursue | IC's embedded task force missions do exactly this — live battle with narrative events and objective choices |
| **Warcraft III: Frozen Throne** | Each campaign had a distinct tone/gameplay style (RPG-heavy Rexxar campaign vs. base-building Scourge campaign) | Enhanced Edition missions vary: some are base-building (classic), some are hero-focused (task force), some are air-only (air campaign) |
| **C&C Remastered Collection** | Bonus gallery content — behind-the-scenes art, remastered music, developer commentary | IC Enhanced Edition could include mission designer commentary (text/audio notes the player can toggle during briefings) |
| **Halo: Reach** | Menu background and music change per campaign chapter | Campaign menu scenes: each act of the Enhanced Edition changes the main menu |
| **Fire Emblem** | Permadeath creates emotional investment in individual units; branching paths based on who survives | IC's roster carryover does this — lose Tanya early and the entire campaign arc changes. Some missions only exist if specific heroes survived |

#### Player Settings

```
Campaign Settings — Allied Campaign
  ✅ Classic Missions (14 missions — always available)
  🔲 IC Enhanced Edition
      ✅ Counterstrike Missions (woven into campaign timeline)
      ✅ Aftermath Missions (woven into campaign timeline)
      ✅ IC Original Missions (task force, air campaign, spy ops)
      ✅ Hero Progression (Tanya XP/skills across all missions)
      ✅ Decision Points (choose your path at key moments)
      ✅ Dynamic Weather
      ✅ Campaign Menu Scenes
      🔲 Co-op Missions (requires second player)
```

Each sub-feature is independently toggleable. A player can enable Counterstrike integration but disable IC original missions. The campaign graph adjusts — disabled branches are hidden, and the graph reconnects through the classic path.

#### Side Mission Rewards — Making Optional Content Meaningful

Side missions must feed back into the main campaign in tangible, visible ways. A side mission that doesn't affect anything feels disconnected — the player notices when the world doesn't react to what they did. The goal: completing a side mission should make the player *feel* the result in the next main mission.

**Reward design principles:**

1. **Specific, not generic.** "Enemy has no air support next mission" is meaningful. "+500 credits" is forgettable.
2. **Visible consequence.** The next main mission briefing references the side mission: *"Thanks to your sabotage, Soviet air defenses are offline."* The world notices.
3. **Real cost for skipping.** Missing a side mission means a harder next mission, a missed unit, or a closed branch — not just slightly less XP.
4. **Cumulative bonuses.** Multiple side missions in the same act compound: spy network + radar destroyed = full intel on the enemy base layout.
5. **Exclusive content.** Some branches/missions/units only exist if specific side missions were completed — rewards thorough players with content casual players never see.

**Reward categories:**

```yaml
# Side mission outcome → main campaign effect
# All implemented via existing D021 state_effects + flags + Lua

```

**Lua implementation (reads flags set by side missions):**

```lua
-- Main mission setup: check what side missions the player completed
Events.on("mission_start", function()
  -- Direct tactical advantage
  if Campaign.get_flag("soviet_radar_destroyed") then
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { disable_ability = "air_strike" })
  end

  if Campaign.get_flag("ammo_supply_disrupted") then
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { max_veterancy = "rookie" })
  end

  if Campaign.get_flag("power_grid_down") then
    Trigger.schedule(0, function()
      Trigger.disable_structures_by_type("tesla_coil", { duration_ticks = 3600 })
      Trigger.disable_structures_by_type("sam_site", { duration_ticks = 3600 })
    end)
  end

  -- Intelligence advantage
  if Campaign.get_flag("spy_network_active") then
    Player.reveal_shroud_percentage(0.4)  -- reveal 40% of the map
  end

  -- Compound bonus: full intel
  if Campaign.get_flag("spy_network_active") and Campaign.get_flag("soviet_radar_destroyed") then
    Player.reveal_all_enemies()  -- show all enemy units at mission start
    UI.show_notification("Full battlefield intel active. All enemy positions known.")
  end

  -- Roster additions from side missions appear as reinforcements
  local rescued = Campaign.get_roster_by_flag("rescued_in_side_mission")
  if #rescued > 0 then
    Trigger.spawn_reinforcements_from_roster(rescued, "allied_reinforcement_zone")
    UI.show_notification(#rescued .. " units from your previous operations have joined the fight.")
  end
end)
```

**How the briefing acknowledges side mission results:**

```yaml
# Main mission briefing with conditional lines
mission:
  id: allied_06
  briefing:
    base_text: "Commander, the assault on the Soviet forward base begins at dawn."
    conditional_lines:
      - flag: soviet_radar_destroyed
        text: "Good news — the radar station you destroyed last week has left their air command blind. No MiG support expected."
      - flag: ammo_supply_disrupted
        text: "Intelligence reports the ammo dump sabotage has taken effect. Enemy units are under-supplied."
      - flag: spy_network_active
        text: "Our spy network has provided detailed positions of their defenses. You'll have partial intel."
      - flag_absent: soviet_radar_destroyed
        text: "Be warned — Soviet air support is fully operational. Expect MiG patrols."
      - compound: { spy_network_active: true, soviet_radar_destroyed: true }
        text: "Between our spies and the radar blackout, we have full battlefield awareness. Press the advantage."
```

The briefing dynamically assembles based on which side missions the player completed. A player who did everything hears good news. A player who skipped everything hears warnings. The same mission, different context — the world reacts to what you did (or didn't do).

#### Failure as Consequence, Not Game Over (Spectrum Outcomes)

Classic C&C missions have two outcomes: win or lose. Lose means retry. The Enhanced Edition uses **spectrum outcomes** — the same mission can have 3-4 named results, each leading to a different next mission with different consequences. Failure doesn't end the campaign; it makes the campaign harder and different.

**Planned example — "Destroy the Bridges" (Tanya mission):**

This is the **simple direct-branch pattern**: capture routes immediately into a rescue mission or harder follow-up. Campaigns that want "rescue now, later, or never" escalation across later nodes should use the bounded pending-branch extension described above, not overload this simpler pattern.

```yaml
mission:
  id: enhanced_bridge_assault
  type: embedded_task_force
  hero: tanya
  description: "Tanya must destroy three bridges to cut off Soviet reinforcements before the main assault."

  outcomes:
    # Best case: all bridges destroyed
    total_success:
      condition: "bridges_destroyed == 3"
      next: allied_08a_easy
      state_effects:
        set_flag:
          bridges_destroyed: 3
          reinforcement_route: severed
      briefing_next: "All three bridges are down. The Soviets are completely cut off. This will be a clean sweep."

    # Partial success: some bridges destroyed
    partial_success:
      condition: "bridges_destroyed >= 1 AND bridges_destroyed < 3"
      next: allied_08a_medium
      state_effects:
        set_flag:
          bridges_destroyed: $bridges_destroyed
          reinforcement_route: reduced
      briefing_next: "We got some of the bridges, but enemy reinforcements are still trickling through. Expect heavier resistance."

    # Failed but Tanya escaped
    failed_escaped:
      condition: "bridges_destroyed == 0 AND hero_alive(tanya)"
      next: allied_08b_hard
      state_effects:
        set_flag:
          bridges_intact: true
          reinforcement_route: full
          tanya_reputation: setback
      briefing_next: "The bridges are intact. The full Soviet armored division is rolling across. Commander, prepare for a hard fight."

    # Failed and Tanya captured
    tanya_captured:
      condition: "bridges_destroyed == 0 AND NOT hero_alive(tanya)"
      next: allied_08c_rescue
      state_effects:
        set_flag:
          bridges_intact: true
          tanya_captured: true
        hero_status:
          tanya: captured
      briefing_next: "We've lost contact with Tanya. Intel suggests she's been taken to the Soviet detention facility. New priority: rescue operation."

    # Failed but Tanya killed (hero death_policy: wounded)
    tanya_wounded:
      condition: "hero_wounded(tanya)"
      next: allied_08b_hard
      state_effects:
        set_flag:
          bridges_intact: true
          tanya_wounded: true
        hero_status:
          tanya: wounded   # Tanya unavailable for 2 missions (recovery)
      briefing_next: "Tanya is wounded and being evacuated. She'll be out of action for a while. We proceed without her."
```

**How the next main mission reacts (Lua):**

```lua
-- allied_08 setup: adapts based on bridge mission outcome
Events.on("mission_start", function()
  local bridges = Campaign.get_flag("bridges_destroyed") or 0

  if bridges == 3 then
    -- Easy variant: enemy has no reinforcements
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { disable_reinforcements = true })
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { starting_units_multiplier = 0.5 })
  elseif bridges >= 1 then
    -- Medium: reduced reinforcements
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { reinforcement_delay_ticks = 3600 })  -- delayed by 3 min
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { starting_units_multiplier = 0.75 })
  else
    -- Hard: full enemy force, bridges intact
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { reinforcement_interval_ticks = 1200 })  -- every 60 seconds
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { starting_units_multiplier = 1.0 })
  end

  -- Tanya unavailable if captured or wounded
  if Campaign.get_flag("tanya_captured") then
    -- This mission becomes harder without Tanya
    UI.show_notification("Tanya is being held at the detention facility. You're on your own.")
  elseif Campaign.get_flag("tanya_wounded") then
    UI.show_notification("Tanya is recovering from her injuries. She'll rejoin in two missions.")
  end
end)
```

**The spectrum:** The player never sees a "Mission Failed" screen. Every outcome — total success, partial success, failure with escape, capture, wounding — leads to a *different* next mission or a *different version* of the same mission. The campaign continues, but the player's performance shapes what comes next. A player who destroyed all three bridges gets a victory lap. A player who got Tanya captured gets a rescue mission they wouldn't have otherwise seen. Both paths are content. Both are valid. Neither is "wrong." In more advanced campaign designs, that capture branch can instead become a bounded pending rescue opportunity with escalating penalties.

This pattern applies to any Enhanced Edition mission — not just the bridge example. Every mission should have at least 2-3 meaningfully different outcomes that branch the campaign or modify the next mission's conditions.

### Unit Roster & Persistence

Inspired by Operation Flashpoint: Resistance — surviving units are precious resources that carry forward, creating emotional investment and strategic consequences.

**Unit Roster:**
```rust
/// Persistent unit state that carries between campaign missions.
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct RosterUnit {
    pub unit_type: UnitTypeId,        // e.g., "medium_tank", "tanya"
    pub name: Option<String>,         // optional custom name
    pub veterancy: VeterancyLevel,    // rookie → veteran → elite → heroic
    pub kills: u32,                   // lifetime kill count
    pub missions_survived: u32,       // how many missions this unit has lived through
    pub equipment: Vec<EquipmentId>,  // OFP:R-style captured/found equipment
    pub custom_state: HashMap<String, Value>, // mod-extensible per-unit state
}
```

**Carryover modes** (per campaign transition):

| Mode        | Behavior                                                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`      | Clean slate — the next mission provides its own units                                 |
| `surviving` | All player units alive at mission end join the roster                                   |
| `extracted` | Only units inside a designated extraction zone carry over (OFP-style "get to the evac") |
| `selected`  | Lua script explicitly picks which units carry over                                      |
| `custom`    | Full Lua control — script reads unit list, decides what persists                      |

**Veterancy across missions:**
- Units gain experience from kills and surviving missions
- A veteran tank from mission 1 is still veteran in mission 5
- Losing a veteran unit hurts — they're irreplaceable until you earn new ones
- Veterancy grants stat bonuses (configurable in YAML rules, per balance preset)

**Equipment persistence (OFP: Resistance model):**
- Captured enemy vehicles at mission end go into the equipment pool
- Found supply crates add to available equipment
- Next mission's starting loadout can draw from the equipment pool
- Modders can define custom persistent items

### Campaign Progress Metadata & GUI Semantics (Branching-Safe, Spoiler-Safe)

The campaign UI should display **progress metadata** (mission counts, completion %, farthest progress, time played), but D021 campaigns are branching graphs — not a simple linear list. To avoid confusing or misleading numbers, D021 defines these metrics explicitly:

- **`unique_missions_completed`**: count of distinct mission nodes completed across local history (best "completion %" metric for branching campaigns)
- **`current_path_depth`**: depth of the active run's current path (useful for "where am I now?")
- **`best_path_depth`**: farthest path depth the player has reached in local history (all-time "farthest reached" metric)
- **`endings_unlocked`**: ending/outcome coverage for replayability (optional if the author marks endings hidden)

**UI guidance (campaign browser / graph / profile):**
- Show **raw counts + percentage** together (example: `5 / 14 missions`, `36%`) — percentages alone hide too much.
- Label branching-aware metrics explicitly (`Best Path Depth`, not just `Farthest Mission`) to avoid ambiguity.
- For classic linear campaigns, `best_path_depth` and `unique completion` are numerically similar; UI may simplify wording.

**Spoiler safety (default):**
- Campaign browser cards should avoid revealing locked mission names.
- Community branch statistics should not reveal branch names or outcome labels until the player reaches that branch point.
- Use generic labels for locked content in comparisons (e.g., `Alternate Branch`, `Hidden Ending`) unless the campaign author opts into full reveal.

**Community comparisons (optional, D052/D053):**
- Local campaign progress is always available offline from `CampaignState` and local SQLite history.
- Community comparisons (percentiles, average completion, popular branch rates) are **opt-in** and must be scoped by `CampaignComparisonScope` (campaign version, module, difficulty, balance preset).
- Community comparison data is informational and social-facing, not competitive/ranked authority.

Campaign state is fully serializable (D010 — snapshottable sim state). Save games capture the entire campaign progress. Replays can replay an entire campaign run, not just individual missions.

### Named Character Presentation Overrides (Optional Convenience Layer)

To make a unit clearly read as a **unique character** (hero/operative/VIP) without forcing a full gameplay-unit fork for every case, D021 supports an optional **presentation override layer** for named characters. This is a **creator convenience** that composes with D038 Named Characters + the Hero Toolkit.

**Intended use cases:**
- unique voice set for a named commando while keeping the same base infantry gameplay role
- alternate portrait/icon/marker for a story-critical engineer/spy
- mission-scoped disguise/winter-gear variants for the same `character_id`
- subtle palette/tint/selection badge differences so a unique actor is readable in battle

**Scope boundary (important):**
- **Presentation overrides are not gameplay rules.** Weapons, armor, speed, abilities, and other gameplay-changing differences still belong in the unit definition and/or hero toolkit progression.
- If the campaign intentionally changes the character's gameplay profile, it should do so explicitly via the unit type binding / hero loadout, not by hiding it inside presentation metadata.
- Presentation overrides are local/content metadata and should not be treated as multiplayer/ranked compatibility changes by themselves (asset pack requirements still apply through normal package/resource dependency rules).

**Canonical schema (shared by D021 runtime data and D038 authoring UI):**

```rust
/// Optional presentation-only overrides for a named character.
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Default)]
pub struct CharacterPresentationOverrides {
    pub portrait_override: Option<String>,       // dialogue / hero sheet portrait asset id
    pub unit_icon_override: Option<String>,      // roster/sidebar/build icon when shown
    pub voice_set_override: Option<String>,      // select/move/attack/deny voice set id
    pub sprite_variant: Option<String>,          // alternate sprite/sequences mapping id
    pub sprite_sequence_override: Option<String>,// sequence remap/alias (module-defined)

**YAML shape (conceptual, exact field names may mirror D038 UI labels):**

```yaml
named_characters:
  - id: tanya
    name: "Tanya"
    unit_type: tanya_commando
    portrait: portraits/tanya_default

    presentation:
      default:
        voice_set: voices/tanya_black_ops
        unit_icon: icons/tanya_black_ops
        palette_variant: hero_red_trim
        selection_badge: hero_star
        minimap_marker_variant: specops_hero
      variants:
        disguise:
          sprite_variant: tanya_officer_disguise
          unit_icon: icons/tanya_officer_disguise
          voice_set: voices/tanya_whisper
          selection_badge: covert_marker
        winter_ops:
          sprite_variant: tanya_winter_gear
          palette_variant: winter_white_trim
```

**Layering model:**
- campaign-level named character definition may provide `presentation.default` and `presentation.variants`
- scenario bindings choose which variant to apply when spawning that character (for example `default`, `disguise`, `winter_ops`)
- D038 exposes this as a previewable authoring panel and a mission-level `Apply Character Presentation Variant` convenience action

### Hero Campaign Toolkit (Optional, Built-In)

Warcraft III-style hero campaigns (for example, Tanya gaining XP, levels, unlockable abilities, and persistent equipment) **fit D021 directly** and should be possible **without engine modding** (no WASM module required). This is an **optional campaign authoring layer** on top of the existing D021 persistent state model and D038's Named Characters / Inventory / Intermission tooling.

**Design intent:**
- **No engine modding for common hero campaigns.** Designers should build hero campaigns through YAML + the SDK Campaign Editor.
- **Optional, not global.** Classic RA-style campaigns remain simple; hero progression is enabled per campaign.
- **Lua is the escape hatch.** Use Lua for bespoke talent effects, unusual status systems, or custom UI logic beyond the built-in toolkit.

**Built-in hero toolkit capabilities (recommended baseline):**
- Persistent hero XP, level, and skill points across missions
- Skill unlocks and mission rewards via debrief/intermission flow
- Hero death/injury policies per character (`must survive`, `wounded`, `campaign_continue`)
- Hero-specific flags/stats for branching dialogue and mission conditions
- Hero loadout/equipment assignment using the standard campaign inventory system

**Example YAML (campaign-level hero progression config):**

```yaml
campaign:
  id: tanya_black_ops
  title: "Tanya: Black Ops"

  persistent_state:
    unit_roster: true
    equipment: true

        - { level: 3, total_xp: 300,  skill_points: 1 }
        - { level: 4, total_xp: 600,  skill_points: 1 }
    heroes:
      - character_id: tanya
        start_level: 1
        skill_tree: tanya_commando

```

**Why this fits the design:** The engine core stays game-agnostic (hero progression is campaign/game-module content, not an engine-core assumption), and the feature composes cleanly with D021 branches, D038 intermissions, and D065 tutorial/onboarding flows.

### Special Operations Mission Archetypes (Hero-in-Battle)

The hero toolkit above handles hero progression (XP, skills, loadouts). This section defines **mission design patterns** where the hero operates inside a live, dynamic battle — not on a separate scripted commando map.

The key difference from classic C&C commando missions: in traditional commando missions, Tanya infiltrates a static, scripted map alone. In these archetypes, the player controls a hero + squad **embedded inside an ongoing AI-vs-AI battle**. The larger battle is dynamic, affects the player, and the player affects it. Think Dota's hero-in-a-war model applied to RTS campaigns.

#### Archetype: Embedded Task Force

The player controls a hero (Tanya) + a small squad (5-15 units) inside a **live battle between AI factions**. Tanks, aircraft, and infantry fight around the player. The player's objectives are special-ops tasks (sabotage, rescue, assassination) that take place within and alongside the larger engagement.

```yaml
mission:
  id: allied_07_bridge_assault
  type: embedded_task_force

  # The live battle — two AI factions fight each other on the same map
  battle_context:
    allied_ai:
      faction: allies
      preset: aggressive          # AI preset (D043)
      relationship_to_player: allied   # same team as player's squad
      base: true                  # has a base, produces units
      objective: "Push across the river and establish a beachhead"
    soviet_ai:
      faction: soviet
      preset: defensive
      relationship_to_player: enemy
      base: true
      objective: "Hold the river crossing at all costs"

  # The player's task force — hero + squad, embedded in the battle

**Lua mission script for the live battle interaction:**

```lua
-- allied_07_bridge_assault.lua

Events.on("mission_start", function()
  -- Start the AI battle — both sides begin fighting immediately
  Ai.activate("allied_ai")
  Ai.activate("soviet_ai")

  -- Player's squad spawns behind allied lines
  local squad = Campaign.get_roster()
  local tanya = Campaign.hero_get("tanya")
  Trigger.spawn_roster_at("player_spawn_zone", squad)

  -- The bridge has a 5-minute timer
  Trigger.start_timer("bridge_demolition", 6000, function()
    if not Var.get("bridge_charges_disarmed") then
      Trigger.destroy_bridge("river_bridge")
      UI.show_notification("The Soviets have destroyed the bridge!")
    end
  end)
end)

-- Player completes a secondary objective → changes the live battle
Events.on("objective_complete", function(ctx)
  if ctx.id == "destroy_radar" then
    -- Soviet AI loses air support capability
    Ai.modify("soviet_ai", { disable_ability = "air_strike" })
    -- Allied AI gains air support
    Ai.modify("allied_ai", { enable_ability = "air_support" })
    Campaign.set_flag("allied_air_support_unlocked", true)

    -- Allied AI sends a relief force to the player's position
    Ai.send_reinforcements("allied_ai", {
      to = Player.get_hero_position(),
      units = { "rifle_squad", "medic" },

    Ai.modify("allied_ai", { morale = "low", posture = "defensive" })
    UI.show_notification("Allied forces fall back after losing their commando.")
  end
end)
```

#### Archetype: Air Campaign (Ground Support)

The player commands air assets and coordinates with ground forces (AI-controlled allied army + local resistance). The player doesn't build — they manage sortie assignments, target designation, and extraction timing.

```yaml
mission:
  id: allied_12_air_superiority
  type: air_campaign

  player:
    role: air_commander
    assets:
      - { type: attack_helicopter, count: 4 }
      - { type: spy_plane, count: 1 }
      - { type: transport_chinook, count: 2 }
    can_build: false
    resupply_point: allied_airfield    # units return here to rearm/repair

  # Ground forces the player coordinates with but doesn't directly control
  ground_allies:
    - id: resistance_cells
      faction: allies
      ai_preset: guerrilla            # hit-and-run, avoids direct engagement
      controllable: false             # player can't give them direct orders
      requestable: true               # player can designate targets for them
    - id: allied_armor
      faction: allies
      ai_preset: cautious
      controllable: false
      requestable: true               # player can call in armor support to a location

  # Spy mechanics — player uses spy plane for recon
  recon:
    spy_plane_reveals: 30             # cells revealed per flyover
    intel_persists: true              # revealed areas stay revealed (shroud removal)
    mark_targets: true                # player can mark spotted targets for ground forces

  objectives:
    primary:
      - id: destroy_sam_sites
        description: "Neutralize all 4 SAM sites to secure air corridors"
      - id: extract_spy
        description: "Land transport at extraction point, load the spy, return to airfield"
    secondary:
      - id: support_resistance_raid
        description: "Provide air cover for the resistance attack on the supply depot"
```

```lua
-- Air campaign Lua — player designates targets for AI ground forces

-- Player marks a target with spy plane recon
Events.on("target_designated", function(ctx)
  -- Resistance cells receive the target and plan an attack
  Ai.assign_target("resistance_cells", ctx.target_position, {
    attack_type = "raid",
    wait_for_air_cover = true  -- they won't attack until player provides air support
  })
  UI.show_notification("Resistance: 'Target received. Awaiting your air cover.'")
end)

-- Player provides air cover → resistance attacks
Events.on("air_units_in_area", function(ctx)
  if ctx.area == Ai.get_pending_target("resistance_cells") then
    Ai.execute_attack("resistance_cells")
    UI.show_notification("Resistance: 'Air cover confirmed. Moving in!'")
  end
end)
```

#### Archetype: Spy Infiltration (Behind Enemy Lines)

The player controls a spy + small cell operating behind enemy lines. The larger battle happens on the "front" — the player operates in the enemy rear. The player's sabotage actions weaken the enemy's front-line forces.

```yaml
mission:
  id: soviet_05_behind_the_lines
  type: spy_infiltration

  player:
    hero: spy
    squad: [ spy, saboteur, sniper ]
    can_build: false
    detection_system:
      enabled: true
      alert_levels: [ undetected, suspicious, alerted, hunted ]
      # Player actions affect alert level:
      # - killing guards quietly: no change
      # - explosions: +1 level
      # - spotted by patrol: +1 level
      # - destroying radar: resets to 'undetected'

  # The front-line battle (player can see its effects but operates separately)
  front_line:
    soviet_ai:
      faction: soviet
      objective: "Hold the front line against Allied assault"
    allied_ai:
      faction: allies
      objective: "Break through Soviet defenses"
    # Player's sabotage actions weaken the Soviet front:
    sabotage_effects:
      - action: "destroy_ammo_dump"
        front_effect: "Soviet AI loses artillery support for 3 minutes"
      - action: "cut_supply_line"
        front_effect: "Soviet AI unit production slowed by 50% for 2 minutes"
      - action: "hack_comms"
        front_effect: "Soviet AI coordination disrupted — units fight independently"

  outcomes:
    victory_front_collapses:
      condition: "3+ sabotage_effects_active AND allied_ai_breaks_through"
      description: "Your sabotage broke the Soviet lines. The Allies pour through."
    victory_extraction:
      condition: "all_primary_objectives_complete AND squad_extracted"
      description: "Mission complete. The intel will change the course of the war."
```

#### How These Archetypes Use Existing Systems

| System | Role in Hero-in-Battle Missions |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| **D021 Campaign Graph** | Missions are nodes in the branching graph. Outcomes (bridge saved/lost, hero alive/dead) create branches |
| **D021 Hero Toolkit** | Tanya gains XP from mission objectives. Skills unlock across the campaign arc |
| **D021 Roster Carryover** | Squad members survive between missions. Lost units stay lost |
| **D043 AI Presets** | Allied and enemy AI factions use preset behaviors (aggressive, defensive, guerrilla) |
| **D070 Commander & SpecOps** | In co-op, one player can be the Commander (controlling the allied AI's base/production) while another is the SpecOps player (controlling Tanya's squad). The request economy (reinforcements, air support) maps directly to D070's coordination surfaces |
| **D059 Beacons & Coordination** | The reinforcement request wheel uses D059's beacon/ping system. "Need CAS", "Need Extraction" are D059 request types |
| **Lua Scripting (Tier 2)** | All battle interactions (AI modification, reinforcement triggers, objective effects) are Lua scripts. No WASM needed |
| **D022 Dynamic Weather** | Weather affects the battle (fog reduces air effectiveness, rain slows armor) |

**No new engine systems required.** These mission archetypes compose existing systems: AI presets run the battle, Lua scripts connect player actions to battle effects, the hero toolkit handles progression, and the campaign graph handles branching. The only new content is the mission YAML and Lua scripts — all authored by campaign designers, not engine developers.

### Campaign Menu Scenes (Evolving Main Menu Background)

Campaign authors can define **menu scenes** that change the main menu background to reflect the player's current campaign progress. When the player returns to the main menu during a campaign playthrough, the background shows a scene tied to where they are in the story — an evolving title screen pattern used by Half-Life 2, Halo: Reach, Warcraft III, and others (see `player-flow/main-menu.md` § Campaign-Progress Menu Background for prior art).

This is an authoring feature, not an engine system. The engine reads the `menu_scenes` table from the campaign YAML and matches the player's `CampaignState` to select the active scene. No new engine code — just YAML configuration + scene assets.

```yaml
# Campaign YAML — menu scene definitions
campaign:
  id: allied_campaign
  title: "Allied Campaign"

  # Menu scenes — matched in order, first match wins
  menu_scenes:
    # Act 1: Early war — daylight naval scene
    - match:
        missions_completed_lt: 3       # before mission 3
      scene:
        type: video_loop               # pre-rendered video
        video: "media/menu/act1_naval_fleet.webm"
        audio: "media/menu/act1_radio_chatter.opus"  # ambient radio, plays under menu music
        audio_volume: 0.3

    # Act 2: Night operations — air campaign

**Scene types:**

| Type | What It Is | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `shellmap` | Live in-game scene — a small map with a Lua script running AI units. Uses the existing shellmap infrastructure. Renders behind the menu at reduced priority | Dynamic scenes: a base under siege, a patrol formation, a naval convoy. The player sees a living piece of the campaign world |
| `video_loop` | A `.webm` video playing in a seamless loop. Optional ambient audio track (radio chatter, engine noise, wind) plays behind menu music at configurable volume | Cinematic scenes: cockpit view of night flight, war room briefing, satellite surveillance footage. Pre-rendered = consistent quality, no sim overhead |
| `static_image` | A single image (artwork, screenshot, concept art) | Simple scenes: victory aftermath, chapter title cards, faction banners |

**Match rules:**

| Condition | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `missions_completed_lt` | integer | Current `CampaignState.completed_missions.len()` < value |
| `missions_completed_gte` | integer | Current `CampaignState.completed_missions.len()` >= value |
| `current_mission` | string | `CampaignState.current_mission` matches this mission ID |
| `flag` | map | All specified flags match their values in `CampaignState.flags` |
| `hero_level_gte` | map | Hero character's level >= value (e.g., `{ tanya: 3 }`) |
| `{}` (empty) | — | Matches everything — use as fallback |

Conditions are evaluated **in order**; the first matching entry wins. This allows flag-based branching: the bridge-destroyed variant (with its `flag: { bridge_status: destroyed }` condition) is listed before the generic Act 3 entry, so it takes priority when the flag is set.

**Workshop support:** Community campaigns published via Workshop include their `menu_scenes` table and all referenced assets (videos, images, shellmap maps/scripts). The Workshop packaging system (D049) bundles scene assets as part of the campaign package. The SDK Campaign Editor (D038) provides a "Menu Scenes" panel for authoring and previewing scenes per campaign stage.

**Player override:** The player can always override the campaign scene by selecting a different background style in Settings → Video (static image, shellmap AI, personal highlights, community highlights). Campaign scenes are the default *when authored by the campaign* and *when the player hasn't chosen something else*.

### Lua Campaign API

Mission scripts interact with campaign state through a sandboxed API:

```lua
-- === Reading campaign state ===

-- Get the unit roster (surviving units from previous missions)
local roster = Campaign.get_roster()
for _, unit in ipairs(roster) do
    -- Spawn each surviving unit at a designated entry point
    local spawned = SpawnUnit(unit.type, entry_point)
    spawned:set_veterancy(unit.veterancy)
    spawned:set_name(unit.name)
end

-- Read story flags set by previous missions
if Campaign.get_flag("bridge_status") == "intact" then
    -- Bridge exists on this map — open the crossing
    bridge_actor:set_state("intact")
else
    -- Bridge was destroyed — it's rubble
    bridge_actor:set_state("destroyed")
end

-- Check cumulative stats
if Campaign.get_stat("total_units_lost") > 50 then
    -- Player has been losing lots of units — offer reinforcements
    trigger_reinforcements()
end

-- === Writing campaign state ===

-- Signal mission completion with a named outcome
function OnObjectiveComplete()
    if bridge:is_alive() then
        Campaign.complete("victory_bridge_intact")
    else
        Campaign.complete("victory_bridge_destroyed")
    end
end

-- Set custom flags for future missions to read
Campaign.set_flag("captured_radar", true)
Campaign.set_flag("enemy_morale", "broken")

-- Update roster: mark which units survived
-- (automatic if carryover mode is "surviving" — manual if "selected")
function OnMissionEnd()
    local survivors = GetPlayerUnits():alive()
    for _, unit in ipairs(survivors) do
        Campaign.roster_add(unit)
    end
end

-- Add captured equipment to persistent pool
function OnEnemyVehicleCaptured(vehicle)
    Campaign.equipment_add(vehicle.type)
end

-- Failure doesn't mean game over — it's just another outcome
function OnPlayerBaseDestroyed()
    Campaign.complete("defeat")  -- campaign graph decides what happens next
end
```

#### Hero progression helpers (optional built-in toolkit)

When `hero_toolkit.enabled` is true, the campaign API exposes built-in helpers for common hero-campaign flows. These are convenience functions over D021 campaign state; they do not require WASM or custom engine code.

```lua
-- Award XP to Tanya after destroying anti-air positions
Campaign.hero_add_xp("tanya", 150, { reason = "aa_sabotage" })

-- Check level gate before enabling a side objective/dialogue option
if Campaign.hero_get_level("tanya") >= 3 then
    Campaign.set_flag("tanya_can_infiltrate_lab", true)
end

-- Grant a skill as a mission reward or intermission choice outcome
Campaign.hero_unlock_skill("tanya", "satchel_charge_mk2")

-- Modify hero-specific stats/flags for branching missions/dialogue
Campaign.hero_set_stat("tanya", "stealth", 4)
Campaign.hero_set_flag("tanya", "injured_last_mission", false)

-- Query persistent hero state (for UI or mission logic)
local tanya = Campaign.hero_get("tanya")
print(tanya.level, tanya.xp, tanya.unspent_skill_points)
```

**Scope boundary:** These helpers cover common hero-RPG campaign patterns (XP, levels, skills, hero flags, progression rewards). Bespoke systems (random loot affixes, complex proc trees, fully custom hero UIs) remain the domain of Lua (and optionally WASM for extreme cases).

### Adaptive Difficulty via Campaign State

Campaign state enables dynamic difficulty without an explicit slider:

```yaml
# In a mission's carryover config:
adaptive:
  # If player lost the previous mission, give them extra resources
  on_previous_defeat:
    bonus_resources: 2000
    bonus_units: [medium_tank, medium_tank, rifle_infantry, rifle_infantry]
  # If player blitzed the previous mission, make this one harder
  on_previous_fast_victory:    # completed in < 50% of par time
    extra_enemy_waves: 1
    enemy_veterancy_boost: 1
  # Scale to cumulative performance
  scaling:
    low_roster:                # < 5 surviving units
      reinforcement_schedule: accelerated
    high_roster:               # > 20 surviving units
      enemy_count_multiplier: 1.3
```

This is not AI-adaptive difficulty (that's D016/`ic-llm`). This is **designer-authored conditional logic** expressed in YAML — the campaign reacts to the player's cumulative performance without any LLM involvement.

> **Dynamic Mission Flow:** Individual missions within a campaign can use **map layers** (dynamic expansion), **sub-map transitions** (building interiors), and **phase briefings** (mid-mission cutscenes) to create multi-phase missions with progressive reveals and infiltration sequences. Flags set during sub-map transitions (e.g., `radar_destroyed`, `radar_captured`) are written to `Campaign.set_flag()` and persist across missions — a spy's infiltration outcome in mission 3 can affect the enemy's capabilities in mission 5. See `04-MODDING.md` § Dynamic Mission Flow for the full system design, Lua API, and worked examples.

> **D070 extension path (future "Ops Campaigns"):** D070's `Commander & Field Ops` asymmetric co-op mode is **v1 match-based** by default (session-local field progression), but it composes with D021 later. A campaign can wrap D070-style missions and persist squad/hero state, requisition unlocks, and role-specific flags across missions using the same `CampaignState` and `Campaign.set_flag()` model defined here. This includes optional **hero-style SpecOps leaders** (e.g., Tanya-like or custom commandos) using the built-in hero toolkit for XP/skills/loadouts between matches/missions. This is an optional campaign layer, not a requirement for the base D070 mode.

> **Commander rescue bootstrap pattern (D021 + D070-adjacent Commander Avatar modes):** A mini-campaign can intentionally start with command/building systems disabled because the commander is captured/missing. Mission 1 is a SpecOps rescue/infiltration scenario; on success, Lua sets a campaign flag such as `commander_recovered = true`. Subsequent missions check this flag to enable commander-avatar presence mechanics, base construction/production menus, support powers, or broader unit command surfaces. This is a recommended way to teach layered mechanics while making the commander narratively and mechanically important.

> **D070 proving mini-campaign pattern ("Ops Prologue"):** A short 3-4 mission mini-campaign is the preferred vertical slice for validating `Commander & SpecOps` (D070) before promoting it as a polished built-in mode/template. Recommended structure:
> 1. **Rescue the Commander** (SpecOps-only, infiltration/extraction, command/building restricted)
> 2. **Establish Forward Command** (commander recovered, limited support/building unlocked)
> 3. **Joint Operation** (full Commander + SpecOps strategic/field/joint objectives)
> 4. *(Optional)* **Counterstrike / Defense** (enemy counter-ops pressure, commander-avatar survivability/readability test)
>
> This pattern is valuable both as a player-facing mini-campaign and as an internal implementation/playtest harness because it validates D021 flags, D070 role flow, D059 request UX, and D065 onboarding in one narrative arc.

> **D070 pacing extension pattern ("Operational Momentum" / "one more phase"):** An `Ops Campaign` can preserve D070's optional Operational Momentum pacing across missions by storing lane progress and war-effort outcomes as campaign state/flags (for example `intel_chain_progress`, `command_network_tier`, `superweapon_delays_applied`, `forward_lz_unlocked`). The next mission can then react with support availability changes, route options, enemy readiness, or objective variants. UI should present these as **branching-safe, spoiler-safe progress summaries** (current gains + next likely payoff), not as a giant opaque meta-score.

### Tutorial Campaigns — Progressive Element Introduction (D065)

The campaign system supports **tutorial campaigns** — campaigns designed to teach game mechanics (or mod mechanics) one at a time. Tutorial campaigns use everything above (branching graphs, state persistence, adaptive difficulty) plus the `Tutorial` Lua global (D065) to restrict and reveal gameplay elements progressively.

This pattern works for the built-in Commander School and for modder-created tutorial campaigns. A modder introducing custom units, buildings, or mechanics in a total conversion can use the same infrastructure.

#### End-to-End Example: "Scorched Earth" Mod Tutorial

A modder has created a "Scorched Earth" mod that adds a flamethrower infantry unit, an incendiary airstrike superweapon, and a fire-spreading terrain mechanic. They want a 4-mission tutorial that introduces each new element before the player encounters it in the main campaign.

**Campaign definition:**

```yaml
# mods/scorched-earth/campaigns/tutorial/campaign.yaml
campaign:
  id: scorched_tutorial
  title: "Scorched Earth — Field Training"
  description: "Learn the fire mechanics before you burn everything down"
  start_mission: se_01
  category: tutorial           # appears under Campaign → Tutorial
  requires_mod: scorched-earth
  icon: scorched_tutorial_icon

  persistent_state:
    unit_roster: false           # no carryover for tutorial missions
    custom_flags:
      mechanics_learned: []      # tracks which mod mechanics the player has used

  missions:
    se_01:
      map: missions/scorched-tutorial/01-meet-the-pyro
      briefing: briefings/scorched/01.yaml
      outcomes:
        pass:
          next: se_02
          state_effects:
            append_flag: { mechanics_learned: [flamethrower, fire_spread] }
        skip:
          next: se_02
          state_effects:
            append_flag: { mechanics_learned: [flamethrower, fire_spread] }

    se_02:
      map: missions/scorched-tutorial/02-controlled-burn
      briefing: briefings/scorched/02.yaml
      outcomes:
        pass:
          next: se_03
          state_effects:
            append_flag: { mechanics_learned: [firebreak, extinguish] }
        struggle:
          next: se_02  # retry the same mission with more resources
          adaptive:
            on_previous_defeat:
              bonus_units: [fire_truck, fire_truck]
        skip:
          next: se_03

    se_03:
      map: missions/scorched-tutorial/03-call-the-airstrike
      briefing: briefings/scorched/03.yaml
      outcomes:
        pass:
          next: se_04
          state_effects:
            append_flag: { mechanics_learned: [incendiary_airstrike] }
        skip:
          next: se_04

    se_04:
      map: missions/scorched-tutorial/04-trial-by-fire
      briefing: briefings/scorched/04.yaml
      outcomes:
        pass:
          description: "Training complete — you're ready for the Scorched Earth campaign"
```

**Mission 01 Lua script — introducing the flamethrower and fire spread:**

```lua
-- mods/scorched-earth/missions/scorched-tutorial/01-meet-the-pyro.lua

function OnMissionStart()
    local player = Player.GetPlayer("GoodGuy")
    local enemy = Player.GetPlayer("BadGuy")

    -- Restrict everything except the new flame units
    Tutorial.RestrictSidebar(true)
    Tutorial.RestrictOrders({"move", "stop", "attack"})

    -- Spawn player's flame squad
    local pyros = Actor.Create("flame_trooper", player, spawn_south, { count = 3 })

    -- Spawn enemy bunker (wood — flammable)
    local bunker = Actor.Create("wood_bunker", enemy, bunker_pos)

    -- Step 1: Move to position
    Tutorial.SetStep("approach", {
        title = "Deploy the Pyros",
        hint = "Select your Flame Troopers and move them toward the enemy bunker.",
        focus_area = bunker_pos,
        eva_line = "new_unit_flame_trooper",
        completion = { type = "move_to", area = approach_zone }
    })
end

function OnStepComplete(step_id)
    if step_id == "approach" then
        -- Step 2: Attack the bunker
        Tutorial.SetStep("ignite", {
            title = "Set It Ablaze",
            hint = "Right-click the wooden bunker to attack it. " ..
                   "Flame Troopers set structures on fire — watch it spread.",
            highlight_ui = "command_bar",
            completion = { type = "action", action = "attack", target_type = "wood_bunker" }
        })

    elseif step_id == "ignite" then
        -- Step 3: Observe fire spread (no player action needed — just watch)
        Tutorial.ShowHint(
            "Fire spreads to adjacent flammable tiles. " ..
            "Trees, wooden structures, and dry grass will catch fire. " ..
            "Stone and water are fireproof.", {
            title = "Fire Spread",
            duration = 10,
            position = "near_building",
            icon = "hint_fire",
        })

        -- Wait for the fire to spread to at least 3 tiles
        Tutorial.SetStep("watch_spread", {
            title = "Watch It Burn",
            hint = "Observe the fire spreading to nearby trees.",
            completion = { type = "custom", lua_condition = "GetFireTileCount() >= 3" }
        })

    elseif step_id == "watch_spread" then
        Tutorial.ShowHint("Fire is a powerful tool — but it burns friend and foe alike. " ..
                          "Be careful where you aim.", {
            title = "A Word of Caution",
            duration = 8,
            position = "screen_center",
        })
        Trigger.AfterDelay(DateTime.Seconds(10), function()
            Campaign.complete("pass")
        end)
    end
end
```

**Mod-specific hints for in-game discovery:**

```yaml
# mods/scorched-earth/hints/fire-hints.yaml
hints:
  - id: se_fire_near_friendly
    title: "Watch Your Flames"
    text: "Fire is spreading toward your own buildings! Move units away or build a firebreak."
    category: mod_specific
    trigger:
      type: custom
      lua_condition: "IsFireNearFriendlyBuilding(5)"  # within 5 cells
    suppression:
      mastery_action: build_firebreak
      mastery_threshold: 2
      cooldown_seconds: 120
      max_shows: 5
    experience_profiles: [all]
    priority: high
    position: near_building
    eva_line = se_fire_warning
```

This pattern scales to any complexity — the modder uses the same YAML campaign format for a 3-mission mod tutorial that the engine uses for its 6-mission Commander School. The `Tutorial` Lua API, `hints.yaml` schema, and scenario editor Tutorial modules (D038) all work identically for first-party and third-party content.

### LLM Campaign Generation

The LLM (`ic-llm`) can generate entire campaign graphs, not just individual missions:

```
User: "Create a 5-mission Soviet campaign where you invade Alaska.
       The player should be able to lose a mission and keep going
       with consequences. Units should carry over between missions."

LLM generates:
  → campaign.yaml (graph with 5+ nodes, branching on outcomes)
  → 5-7 mission files (main path + fallback branches)
  → Lua scripts with Campaign API calls
  → briefing text for each mission
  → carryover rules per transition
```

The template/scene system makes this tractable — the LLM composes from known building blocks rather than generating raw code. Campaign graphs are validated at load time (no orphan nodes, all outcomes have targets).

> **Security (V40):** LLM-generated content (YAML rules, Lua scripts, briefing text) must pass through the `ic mod check` validation pipeline before execution — same as Workshop submissions. Additional defenses: cumulative mission-lifetime resource limits, content filter for generated text, sandboxed preview mode. LLM output is treated as untrusted Tier 2 mod content, never trusted first-party. See `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 40.
