## Project: Rust-Native RTS Engine

**Status:** Pre-development (design phase)  
**Date:** 2026-02-19  
**Codename:** Iron Curtain  
**Author:** David Krasnitsky  

## What This Is

A Rust-native RTS engine that supports OpenRA resource formats (`.mix`, `.shp`, `.pal`, YAML rules) and reimagines internals with modern architecture. Not a clone or port — a complementary project offering different tradeoffs (performance, modding, portability) with full OpenRA mod compatibility as the zero-cost migration path. OpenRA is an excellent project; IC explores what a clean-sheet Rust design can offer the same community.

**LLM feature overview (optional / experimental):** See [Experimental LLM Modes & Plans](LLM-MODES.md) for a consolidated overview of planned LLM gameplay modes, creator tooling, and external-tool integrations. The project is fully designed to work without any LLM configured.

## Key Architectural Invariants

These are non-negotiable across the entire project:

1. **Simulation is pure and deterministic.** No I/O, no floats, no network awareness. Takes orders, produces state. Period.
2. **Network model is pluggable via trait.** `GameLoop<N: NetworkModel, I: InputSource>` is generic over both network model and input source. The sim has zero imports from `ic-net`. They share only `ic-protocol`. Within the lockstep family (all shipping implementations), swapping network backends touches zero sim code. Non-lockstep architectures (rollback, FogAuth) would also leave `ic-sim` untouched but may require game loop extension in `ic-game`.
3. **Modding is tiered.** YAML (data) → Lua (scripting) → WASM (power). Each tier is optional and sandboxed.
4. **Bevy as framework.** ECS scheduling, rendering, asset pipeline, audio — Bevy handles infrastructure so we focus on game logic. Custom render passes and SIMD only where profiling justifies it.
5. **Efficiency-first performance.** Better algorithms, cache-friendly ECS, zero-allocation hot paths, simulation LOD, amortized work — THEN multi-core as a bonus layer. A 2-core laptop must run 500 units smoothly.
6. **Real YAML, not MiniYAML.** Standard `serde_yaml` with inheritance resolved at load time.
7. **OpenRA compatibility is at the data/community layer, not the simulation layer.** Same mods, same maps, shared server browser — but not bit-identical simulation.
8. **Full resource compatibility with Red Alert and OpenRA.** Every .mix, .shp, .pal, .aud, .oramap, and YAML rule file from the original game and OpenRA must load correctly. This is non-negotiable — the community's existing work is sacred.
9. **Engine core is game-agnostic.** No game-specific enums, resource types, or unit categories in engine core. Positions are 3D (`WorldPos { x, y, z }`). System pipeline is registered per game module, not hardcoded.
10. **Platform-agnostic by design.** Input is abstracted behind `InputSource` trait. UI layout is responsive (adapts to screen size via `ScreenClass`). No raw `std::fs` — all assets go through Bevy's asset system. Render quality is runtime-configurable.
